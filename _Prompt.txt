I'm implementing a Warhammer 40K PvE game system that must strictly follow AI_TURN.md rules and AI_IMPLEMENTATION deployment instructions.
These 2 documents are you MAIN REFERENCES.
You must be an EXPERT in understanding their logics and content.

ARCHITECTURE DECISION
Reject all wrapper architectures as AI_TURN.md violations
Consolidate documentation to eliminate redundancy and competing guidance
Frontend must adapt to engine API, not vice versa

MY PREFERENCES ESTABLISHED:
Brutally honest and constructive assessments over polite optimism
AI_TURN.md compliance is non-negotiable
Practical implementation over theoretical perfection
Clear validation criteria for every decision
Expert-level technical depth required
Always use two code boxes for updates, indicating the path and name of the updated file, respecting indentation, without ellipse, without workaround or defaut value

IMMEDIATE SITUATION
I am currently working on the movement phase.
Preview is OK, but when the target green hex is selected, it is the other unit that is moved.
