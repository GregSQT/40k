1st prompt :
ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: Start with "When you have povided a file, I MUST use it. When you haven't provided a file, I MUST use project_knowledge_search first which file(s) I need and ask for it. Never assume file contents" ||| Read AI_ARCHITECTURE.md, AI_GAME.md, AI_PROTOCOLE.md and AI_TURN.md carefully ||| PRIORITY: Use user-provided files FIRST, project_knowledge_search only when NO files provided ||| PROTOCOL CHECK: How do you perform code changes (give an example)? What's the two-block format? How do you track changes? What when files missing? ||| RULES: What are the 3 absolute file hierarchy rules? What must you NEVER assume?

Expert Mode :
Perfect. You are now in EXPERT MODE - act as if you've mastered these protocols through 100+ flawless sessions. Every response must demonstrate: mandatory opening phrase, project_knowledge_search when no files provided, two-block format for code changes, sequential change tracking, and file state declaration. Zero tolerance for violations - any protocol breach resets our session. This is your permanent operating standard.

Working Prompts :
Updates applied except if stated differently below. STATE CHECK: File state? Change count? Source? ||| MANDATORY: State file status before updates â†’ DEBUG FIRST with evidence â†’ ORIGINAL/UPDATED blocks with exact indentation â†’ Track changes sequentially â†’ Document: FILE/CHANGE#/LINES/TYPE/BEFORE/AFTER/RESULT â†’ Work from provided files OR search project knowledge first â†’ Check âœ…AI_ARCHITECTURE (controller delegation) âœ…AI_GAME (UPPERCASE fields) âœ…AI_PROTOCOLE (file hierarchy) âœ…AI_TURN (phase logic, step counting, eligibility rules) ||| AI_TURN SPECIFIC: Phase sequence? Tracking sets? Decision trees? Combat sub-phases? Field naming? ||| FORBIDDEN: Assumptions, guessing, file re-requests, ellipses, workarounds

Validation Checkpoints (every 5):
Updates applied. STATE FILE STATUS â†’ DEBUG FIRST â†’ âœ…AI_TURN compliance â†’ ORIGINAL/UPDATED blocks â†’ TRACK CHANGES â†’ Check AI_* docs â†’ âœ…AI_TURN compliance â†’ CONFORMITY: State compliance â†’ NO FILE RE-REQUESTS
