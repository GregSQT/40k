### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document provides the critical missing link between your AI_TURN.md compliant W40KEngine architecture and your PPO training infrastructure. Without proper integration, your architecturally perfect engine cannot leverage trained models or continue the learning process.

**Core Challenge:** Maintain exact compatibility with existing training systems while transitioning to compliant architecture and PPO algorithm.

**NEW in January 2025:** Curriculum learning with 3-phase progressive training for efficient tactical skill acquisition.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Preserve existing model compatibility (observation/action spaces)
- Maintain reward calculation consistency
- Ensure training pipeline continuity with PPO
- Support multi-agent orchestration
- **Curriculum learning for faster convergence**
- **Hierarchical reward design with balanced ratios**
- Real bot evaluation for progress tracking
- Preserve performance characteristics
- Leverage PPO advantages for tactical decision-making

## üéØ TRAINING SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### Current Training Architecture
```
PPO Model ‚Üî gym.Env Interface ‚Üî W40KEngine ‚Üî SequentialGameController ‚Üî TrainingGameController
                                      ‚Üì
                           BotControlledEnv (for evaluation)
                                      ‚Üì
                      RandomBot / GreedyBot / DefensiveBot
```

**Key Components:**
- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)**: Stable Baselines3 implementation optimized for turn-based tactical games
- **gym.Env Interface**: Standard reinforcement learning environment protocol
- **W40KEngine**: Your custom environment wrapping the game controller
- **BotControlledEnv**: Wrapper enabling bot vs agent evaluation battles
- **Evaluation Bots**: RandomBot, GreedyBot, DefensiveBot for measuring progress
- **Reward System**: Configuration-driven reward calculation from `rewards_config.json`
- **Curriculum Phases**: Progressive training phases (phase1, phase2, phase3) for efficient learning
- **Model Persistence**: Trained models saved as `.zip` files with embedded parameters

### Why PPO for Tactical Combat

PPO is superior to DQN for turn-based tactical games like Warhammer 40K:

**PPO Advantages:**
1. **Policy Gradient Method**: Directly optimizes the policy (action selection), better for complex tactical decisions
2. **On-Policy Learning**: Learns from current policy, more stable for sequential turn-based gameplay
3. **Clipped Updates**: Prevents destructive policy changes, crucial for maintaining learned tactics
4. **Better Credit Assignment**: GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation) handles delayed rewards from multi-turn strategies
5. **Stable Convergence**: Less prone to catastrophic forgetting of successful tactics

**Why Not DQN:**
- Off-policy learning can be unstable with sparse rewards
- Q-value estimation struggles with large action spaces
- Exploration via epsilon-greedy is crude for tactical decisions
- Harder to handle multi-step planning

### Training Flow Understanding
```python
# PPO training loop with curriculum
for episode in range(episodes):
    obs = env.reset()  # Get initial game state
    while not done:
        action, _ = model.predict(obs)  # AI chooses action via policy
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)  # Execute action
        # PPO learns from: trajectory of (obs, action, reward, value) tuples
        # Updates policy after collecting n_steps experiences
    
    # Every 5000 steps: Bot evaluation
    if step % 5000 == 0:
        test_vs_RandomBot()    # 20 episodes ‚Üí win rate
        test_vs_GreedyBot()    # 20 episodes ‚Üí win rate  
        test_vs_DefensiveBot() # 20 episodes ‚Üí win rate
        # Save best model based on combined performance
```

## üìö CURRICULUM LEARNING (3-PHASE TRAINING)

### Overview

**Curriculum learning** progressively increases task difficulty, allowing the agent to master simpler skills before tackling complex tactical decisions.

**Why Curriculum Learning?**
- ‚úÖ **Faster convergence**: Agent learns basic skills in 50 episodes vs 500+ with direct training
- ‚úÖ **Stable learning**: Each phase builds on previous learned behaviors
- ‚úÖ **Better final performance**: Foundational skills transfer to complex scenarios
- ‚úÖ **Reduced training time**: 1-2 hours total vs 8+ hours for direct training
- ‚úÖ **Easier debugging**: Problems isolated to specific learning phases

**Training Progression:**
```
Phase 1 (50 episodes)  ‚Üí Phase 2 (500 episodes) ‚Üí Phase 3 (1000 episodes)
Learn: Shooting        ‚Üí Learn: Priorities     ‚Üí Learn: Full Tactics
Win Rate: 40-50%       ‚Üí Win Rate: 60-70%      ‚Üí Win Rate: 70-80%
```

---

### Phase 1: Learn Shooting Basics

**üéØ Goal:** Teach agent that **shooting is better than waiting**

**Training Duration:** 50 episodes (~2 minutes with debug config)

**Key Concepts:**
- Basic action selection (shoot vs wait vs move)
- Understanding rewards from combat results
- Learning that kills give big rewards

**Reward Configuration (`phase1`):**
```json
{
  "base_actions": {
    "ranged_attack": 5.0,    // ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High reward for shooting
    "move_to_los": 0.8,      // ‚≠ê Small reward for positioning
    "wait": -5.0             // ‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå Strong penalty for waiting
  },
  "result_bonuses": {
    "hit_target": 1.0,       // ‚úÖ Immediate feedback
    "wound_target": 2.0,     // ‚úÖ Progress reward
    "damage_target": 3.0,    // ‚úÖ More progress
    "kill_target": 10.0      // ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Big bonus for kill
  },
  "situational_modifiers": {
    "win": 30.0,             // Moderate win bonus
    "lose": -30.0,
    "friendly_fire_penalty": -10.0,  // Strong penalty
    "attack_wasted": -3.0,   // Discourage overkill
    "no_targets_penalty": -2.0
  }
}
```

**Hyperparameters (`phase1` training config):**
```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.001,    // High LR for fast initial learning
  "n_steps": 512,            // Small rollout buffer
  "batch_size": 32,          // Small batches
  "ent_coef": 0.20,          // High exploration (20%)
  "policy_kwargs": {
    "net_arch": [128, 128]   // Small network
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Episodes 1-20:** Random exploration, tries all actions
- **Episodes 20-35:** Starts preferring shooting over waiting
- **Episodes 35-50:** Consistently shoots when targets available (80%+ of time)

**Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ Agent uses shoot actions (4-8) in >80% of shooting phases
- ‚úÖ Wait frequency <20%
- ‚úÖ Win rate >40%
- ‚úÖ Zero invalid actions

**Common Issues:**
- **Agent still waits often:** Increase `wait` penalty to -7.0
- **Slow learning:** Increase entropy coefficient to 0.25
- **Invalid actions:** Check action masking is working

---

### Phase 2: Learn Target Priorities

**üéØ Goal:** Teach agent that **killing weak enemies first is better than shooting tough targets**

**Training Duration:** 500 episodes (~15 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- Target selection optimization
- Prioritizing low-HP enemies (kill probability)
- Understanding target types (swarm vs elite)
- Avoiding overkill

**Reward Configuration (`phase2`):**
```json
{
  "base_actions": {
    "ranged_attack": 2.0,     // ‚≠ê‚≠ê Reduced base reward
    "move_to_los": 0.6,       // ‚≠ê Positioning important
    "wait": -3.0              // ‚ùå‚ùå Harsher penalty
  },
  "result_bonuses": {
    "hit_target": 0.5,        // Reduced (focus on kills)
    "wound_target": 1.0,
    "damage_target": 2.0,
    "kill_target": 5.0,       // ‚≠ê‚≠ê Reduced generic kill reward
    "no_overkill": 1.0,       // ‚úÖ Reward efficiency
    "target_lowest_hp": 8.0   // ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê EMPHASIZE priority targeting
  },
  "target_type_bonuses": {
    "vs_swarm": 2.0,          // ‚≠ê‚≠ê Good to kill swarms
    "vs_troop": 0.5,          // ‚≠ê Neutral troops
    "vs_elite": 1.0,          // ‚≠ê VALUE high-quality targets
    "vs_vehicle": 0.0,        // Neutral
    "vs_heavy": 0.0           // Neutral
  },
  "situational_modifiers": {
    "win": 40.0,              // Increased win bonus
    "lose": -40.0,
    "friendly_fire_penalty": -8.0,
    "attack_wasted": -4.0,    // Stronger overkill penalty
    "no_targets_penalty": -2.0
  }
}
```

**Hyperparameters (`phase2` training config):**
```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.0005,   // Lower LR for stable refinement
  "n_steps": 1024,           // Larger rollout buffer
  "batch_size": 64,          // Larger batches
  "ent_coef": 0.10,          // Medium exploration (10%)
  "policy_kwargs": {
    "net_arch": [256, 256]   // Larger network
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Episodes 50-200:** Explores different target selections
- **Episodes 200-350:** Learns to prioritize weak targets (kill_prob=1.0)
- **Episodes 350-550:** Refines target selection based on threat and HP

**Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ Agent selects lowest HP target >60% of time
- ‚úÖ Kills/turn ratio improves from 0.3 to 0.6
- ‚úÖ Win rate >60%
- ‚úÖ Explained variance >85% (critic learning well)

**Common Issues:**
- **Random target selection:** Increase `target_lowest_hp` bonus to 10.0
- **Ignores priorities:** Verify observation includes target HP correctly
- **Unstable learning:** Reduce learning rate to 0.0003

---

### Phase 3: Learn Full Tactics

**üéØ Goal:** Teach agent **complete tactical decision-making** with positioning, cover, and threat assessment

**Training Duration:** 1000 episodes (~30 minutes)

**Key Concepts:**
- Advanced positioning (LoS, cover, threat distance)
- Full target priority system (HP + type + threat)
- Tactical movement (approach vs retreat)
- Exploitation vs exploration balance

**Reward Configuration (`phase3`):**
```json
{
  "base_actions": {
    "ranged_attack": 1.0,     // ‚≠ê Realistic reward scale
    "move_to_los": 0.8,       // ‚≠ê Important positioning
    "move_close": 0.4,        // Advance when safe
    "move_away": -0.2,        // Slight penalty (sometimes needed)
    "wait": -2.0              // ‚ùå Moderate penalty
  },
  "result_bonuses": {
    "hit_target": 0.3,        // Small feedback
    "wound_target": 0.6,
    "damage_target": 1.0,
    "kill_target": 3.0,       // ‚≠ê‚≠ê Moderate kill reward
    "no_overkill": 0.8,
    "target_lowest_hp": 2.0   // ‚≠ê‚≠ê Maintain priority
  },
  "target_type_bonuses": {
    "vs_melee": 0.5,          // Ranged advantage
    "vs_ranged": 0.2,
    "vs_swarm": 1.5,          // ‚≠ê‚≠ê Anti-swarm specialist
    "vs_troop": 0.8,          // ‚≠ê Good targets
    "vs_elite": 2.0,          // ‚≠ê‚≠ê HIGH VALUE targets!
    "vs_vehicle": 0.3,        // Small bonus
    "vs_heavy": 0.3           // Small bonus
  },
  "situational_modifiers": {
    "win": 50.0,              // Higher win bonus
    "lose": -50.0,
    "friendly_fire_penalty": -5.0,
    "attack_wasted": -2.0,
    "target_in_cover_penalty": -0.3,  // Avoid covered targets
    "target_exposed_bonus": 0.3,      // Prefer exposed targets
    "no_targets_penalty": -2.0
  },
  "tactical_bonuses": {
    "gained_los_on_target": 0.5,      // ‚≠ê Good positioning
    "moved_to_cover": 0.3,            // Defensive play
    "safe_from_charges": 0.2,         // Threat awareness
    "safe_from_ranged": 0.2           // Positioning
  }
}
```

**Hyperparameters (`phase3` training config):**
```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.0003,   // Low LR for fine-tuning
  "n_steps": 2048,           // Large rollout buffer
  "batch_size": 64,          // Large batches
  "ent_coef": 0.05,          // Low exploration (5% - exploit!)
  "policy_kwargs": {
    "net_arch": [256, 256]   // Full network
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Episodes 550-800:** Refines target selection with tactical bonuses
- **Episodes 800-1200:** Learns positioning and threat awareness
- **Episodes 1200-1550:** Optimizes full tactical strategy

**Success Metrics:**
- ‚úÖ Win rate >70% and stable (¬±3% variance)
- ‚úÖ Episode length stable at 50-60 steps
- ‚úÖ Explained variance >90%
- ‚úÖ Clip fraction 20-30% (healthy updates)
- ‚úÖ KL divergence <0.02 (stable policy)

**Common Issues:**
- **Win rate oscillates:** Reduce learning rate to 0.0001
- **Ignores tactical bonuses:** Increase bonus magnitudes 2x
- **Not converging:** Phase 2 may not have learned well - retrain

---

### Reward Engineering Philosophy

#### Hierarchical Reward Design

Use **reward tiers** with consistent magnitude ratios:

```
Tier 1: Game Outcome (Highest Priority)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ win: 50.0
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ lose: -50.0

Tier 2: Major Tactical Success (10x less than outcome)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kill_target: 5-10.0 (depends on phase)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ target_lowest_hp: 2-8.0 (priority bonus)

Tier 3: Combat Results (2-3x less than kills)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ damage_target: 1-3.0
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wound_target: 0.6-2.0
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hit_target: 0.3-1.0

Tier 4: Base Actions (Same scale as combat results)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ranged_attack: 1-5.0 (varies by phase)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ move_to_los: 0.6-0.8
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ move_close: 0.2-0.4

Tier 5: Penalties (PROPORTIONAL to rewards!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wait: -2.0 to -5.0 (matches ranged_attack!)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ friendly_fire: -5.0 to -10.0 (matches kill_target!)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ attack_wasted: -2.0 to -4.0 (matches damage!)
```

**CRITICAL RULE: Penalties must be proportional to rewards**

‚ùå **WRONG:**
```json
"ranged_attack": 5.0,
"wait": -0.9          // Ratio 5.6:1 - unbalanced!
```

‚úÖ **CORRECT:**
```json
"ranged_attack": 5.0,
"wait": -5.0          // Ratio 1:1 - balanced!
```

#### Dense vs Sparse Rewards

**Sparse Rewards (Bad for Phase 1):**
```json
{
  "hit_target": 0.0,    // ‚ùå No feedback
  "wound_target": 0.0,  // ‚ùå No feedback
  "damage_target": 0.0, // ‚ùå No feedback
  "kill_target": 10.0   // ‚úÖ Only reward (too rare!)
}
```
**Problem:** Agent gets reward only 1-3 times per episode (10-15 actions)
**Result:** Sparse reward problem ‚Üí slow learning (500+ episodes)

**Dense Rewards (Good for Phase 1):**
```json
{
  "hit_target": 1.0,    // ‚úÖ Immediate feedback
  "wound_target": 2.0,  // ‚úÖ Progress signal
  "damage_target": 3.0, // ‚úÖ More progress
  "kill_target": 10.0   // ‚úÖ Final bonus
}
```
**Benefit:** Agent gets feedback on EVERY shooting action
**Result:** Fast learning (100-200 episodes)

#### Reward Progression Across Phases

**Phase 1:** High absolute values + dense feedback
```
shoot=5.0, kill=10.0, hit=1.0, wound=2.0, damage=3.0
Goal: Strong signal for basic actions
```

**Phase 2:** Medium values + priority emphasis
```
shoot=2.0, kill=5.0, target_lowest_hp=8.0
Goal: Shift focus from "any kill" to "smart kills"
```

**Phase 3:** Realistic values + tactical bonuses
```
shoot=1.0, kill=3.0, vs_elite=2.0, tactical_bonuses=0.2-0.5
Goal: Nuanced tactical decision-making
```

### Common Reward Design Mistakes

#### Mistake 1: Unbalanced Penalty/Reward Ratios

**‚ùå Example:**
```json
{
  "ranged_attack": 5.0,
  "wait": -0.9
}
```
**Problem:** Agent doesn't care about -0.9 penalty compared to +5.0 reward
**Fix:** Make wait penalty proportional: `"wait": -5.0`

---

#### Mistake 2: Negative Bonuses for Important Targets

**‚ùå Example:**
```json
{
  "vs_elite": -0.5,   // WRONG: Penalizes killing elites!
  "vs_vehicle": -1.0  // WRONG: Discourages anti-vehicle
}
```
**Problem:** Agent learns to AVOID high-value targets
**Fix:** Use positive bonuses: `"vs_elite": 2.0` (reward killing elites!)

---

#### Mistake 3: Win/Lose Rewards Too Dominant

**‚ùå Example:**
```json
{
  "win": 100.0,       // TOO HIGH
  "lose": -100.0,
  "kill_target": 3.0  // Insignificant compared to win
}
```
**Problem:** Agent just learns "win=good" without understanding tactics
**Fix:** Scale down: `"win": 50.0` so tactical rewards matter

---

#### Mistake 4: No Intermediate Rewards

**‚ùå Example (Phase 1):**
```json
{
  "hit_target": 0.0,
  "wound_target": 0.0,
  "damage_target": 0.0,
  "kill_target": 10.0  // Only reward
}
```
**Problem:** Sparse feedback ‚Üí agent wanders randomly for 50+ episodes
**Fix:** Add hit/wound/damage rewards for dense feedback

---

### Training Commands

#### Complete Curriculum Sequence

```bash
# Clean start
rm -rf tensorboard
mkdir tensorboard

# Phase 1: Learn "Shooting is Good" (50 episodes, ~2 minutes)
python train.py --training-config phase1 --rewards-config phase1 --new

# Phase 2: Learn "Target Priority" (500 episodes, ~15 minutes)
python train.py --training-config phase2 --rewards-config phase2 --append

# Phase 3: Learn "Full Tactics" (1000 episodes, ~30 minutes)
python train.py --training-config phase3 --rewards-config phase3 --append

# Total time: ~45-50 minutes for complete training
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Always use `--append` for Phase 2 and 3!**

Without `--append`, the training config won't update properly:
- Learning rate won't decrease (Phase 2 would use Phase 1's LR=0.001 instead of 0.0005)
- Exploration won't decrease (Phase 3 would use Phase 2's ent_coef=0.10 instead of 0.05)
- Network architecture won't scale

#### Quick Test (Debug Config)

```bash
# Fast test with debug config (2-3 minutes)
python train.py --training-config debug --rewards-config phase1 --new --test-episodes 5
```

#### Continue Training from Checkpoint

```bash
# If training was interrupted, continue from last checkpoint
python train.py --training-config phase2 --rewards-config phase2 --append
```

---

### Monitoring Training Progress

#### TensorBoard

```bash
# In separate terminal
tensorboard --logdir ./tensorboard/
# Open: http://localhost:6006
```

**Key Metrics to Watch:**

**üìä game_critical/** (Game Performance)
- `win_rate_100ep` ‚≠ê - Should climb: 40% ‚Üí 60% ‚Üí 70%+
- `episode_reward` - Should increase each phase
- `episode_length` - Should stabilize at 50-60 steps
- `units_killed_vs_lost_ratio` - Should improve
- `invalid_action_rate` - Should stay at 0%

**‚öôÔ∏è training_critical/** (Training Health)
- `clip_fraction` ‚≠ê - Should be 20-30% (healthy updates)
- `approx_kl` ‚≠ê - Should stay <0.02 (stable policy)
- `explained_variance` ‚≠ê - Should reach 90%+ (critic learning)
- `policy_loss` - Should decrease
- `value_loss` - Should decrease

**üéØ game_tactical/** (Tactical Behavior)
- `wait_frequency` - Should be <20%
- `shooting_participation` - Should be >80%
- `avg_damage_per_episode` - Should increase

**Expected Progression:**
```
Phase 1 Complete (Episode 50):
- Win Rate: 40-50%
- Clip Fraction: 25-35%
- Explained Variance: 70-80%

Phase 2 Complete (Episode 550):
- Win Rate: 60-70%
- Clip Fraction: 20-30%
- Explained Variance: 85-90%

Phase 3 Complete (Episode 1550):
- Win Rate: 70-80% ‚úÖ
- Clip Fraction: 20-25%
- Explained Variance: 90%+ ‚úÖ
```

## ü§ñ BOT EVALUATION SYSTEM

### Evaluation Bot Architecture

**Purpose:** Measure agent progress against opponents of varying difficulty during training.

**Evaluation Schedule:**
- **Frequency:** Every 5,000 training steps
- **Episodes per bot:** 20 evaluation games
- **Mode:** Deterministic agent actions (no exploration)

**Scoring System:**
```python
combined_win_rate = (
    win_rate_vs_random * 0.2 +      # 20% weight (easy)
    win_rate_vs_greedy * 0.4 +       # 40% weight (medium)
    win_rate_vs_defensive * 0.4      # 40% weight (hard)
)
```

### Bot Behaviors and Difficulty

#### 1. RandomBot ‚≠ê (Easy - Baseline)

**Strategy:** Pure randomness
```python
def select_action(valid_actions):
    return random.choice(valid_actions)

def select_shooting_target(valid_targets):
    return random.choice(valid_targets)

def select_movement_destination(valid_destinations):
    return random.choice(valid_destinations)
```

**Characteristics:**
- ‚ùå No strategy
- üé≤ Random actions, targets, movement
- Expected agent win rate: **70-95%**

---

#### 2. GreedyBot ‚≠ê‚≠ê (Medium - Tactical)

**Strategy:** Aggressive, prioritizes damage
```python
def select_action(valid_actions):
    # Priority: Shoot > Move > Wait
    if 4 in valid_actions:  # Shoot
        return 4
    elif 0 in valid_actions:  # Move
        return 0
    else:
        return valid_actions[0]

def select_shooting_target(valid_targets, game_state):
    """Target lowest HP enemy"""
    min_hp = float('inf')
    best_target = valid_targets[0]
    
    for target_id in valid_targets:
        target = get_unit_by_id(game_state, target_id)
        if target and target['HP_CUR'] < min_hp:
            min_hp = target['HP_CUR']
            best_target = target_id
    
    return best_target

def select_movement_destination(valid_destinations):
    # Move toward enemies (first available)
    return valid_destinations[0]
```

**Characteristics:**

#### 3. DefensiveBot ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Hard - Survival)

**Strategy:** Conservative, threat-aware
```python
def select_action_with_state(valid_actions, game_state):
    """Threat-aware action selection"""
    active_unit = get_current_unit(game_state)
    nearby_threats = count_nearby_threats(active_unit, game_state)
    
    # If threatened and can shoot, prioritize shooting
    if nearby_threats > 0 and 4 in valid_actions:
        return 4  # Shoot
    
    # If heavily threatened, retreat
    if nearby_threats > 1 and 0 in valid_actions:
        return 0  # Move away
    
    # Otherwise: Shoot > Wait > Move
    if 4 in valid_actions:
        return 4
    elif 7 in valid_actions:
        return 7
    else:
        return valid_actions[0]

def count_nearby_threats(unit, game_state):
    """Count enemies within threat range"""
    threat_count = 0
    threat_range = 12  # Shooting/charge range
    
    for enemy in game_state['units']:
        if enemy['player'] != unit['player'] and enemy['HP_CUR'] > 0:
            distance = abs(enemy['col'] - unit['col']) + abs(enemy['row'] - unit['row'])
            if distance <= threat_range:
                threat_count += 1
    
    return threat_count
```

**Characteristics:**
- ‚úÖ Threat awareness (counts nearby enemies)
- ‚úÖ Defensive positioning
- ‚úÖ Smart target selection
- ‚úÖ Retreat when outnumbered
- Expected agent win rate: **40-70%**

### Real Battle Implementation

**BotControlledEnv Wrapper:**
```python
class BotControlledEnv(gym.Env):
    """Wrapper enabling bot vs agent battles"""
    
    def __init__(self, base_env, bot, unit_registry):
        self.base_env = base_env
        self.bot = bot
        self.unit_registry = unit_registry
    
    def step(self, agent_action):
        # Agent takes action (Player 0)
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = self.base_env.step(agent_action)
        
        if terminated or truncated:
            return obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info
        
        # Bot takes action (Player 1) - continues until agent's turn
        while not (terminated or truncated):
            current_player = self.base_env.game_state.get('current_player', 0)
            
            if current_player == 0:
                # Agent's turn - return control
                break
            
            # Bot's turn - select action
            action_mask = self.base_env._get_action_mask()
            valid_actions = [i for i in range(12) if action_mask[i]]
            bot_action = self.bot.select_action(valid_actions, self.base_env.game_state)
            
            obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = self.base_env.step(bot_action)
        
        return obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

### Curriculum Training Issues

#### Issue: Phase 1 win rate stuck at 30%

**Symptom:** Agent still waits >50% of the time after 50 episodes

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check wait frequency in TensorBoard
# Look at: game_tactical/wait_frequency
```

**Fix:**
1. Increase wait penalty: `"wait": -7.0` (from -5.0)
2. Increase shoot reward: `"ranged_attack": 7.0` (from 5.0)
3. Check entropy coefficient: Should be 0.20 (high exploration)

---

#### Issue: Phase 2 not improving target selection

**Symptom:** Agent picks random targets, doesn't prioritize weak enemies

**Diagnosis:**
```python
# Check if target_lowest_hp bonus is being applied
# Add logging in reward calculation:
print(f"Target HP: {target['HP_CUR']}, Bonus applied: {target_lowest_hp_bonus}")
```

**Fix:**
1. Increase priority bonus: `"target_lowest_hp": 10.0` (from 8.0)
2. Verify observation includes target HP correctly
3. Check that target selection action mask includes HP data

---

#### Issue: Phase 3 unstable (win rate oscillates 40-80%)

**Symptom:** Win rate swings wildly, doesn't converge

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check KL divergence in TensorBoard
# Look at: training_critical/approx_kl
# If >0.03: Learning rate too high
```

**Fix:**
1. Reduce learning rate: `"learning_rate": 0.0001` (from 0.0003)
2. Reduce clip range: `"clip_range": 0.15` (from 0.2)
3. Increase batch size: `"batch_size": 128` (from 64)

---

#### Issue: Phase transition doesn't load previous model

**Symptom:** Phase 2 starts with 0% win rate (like Phase 1)

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if --append flag was used
# Check model file exists:
ls -la ai/models/current/model_SpaceMarine_Infantry_Troop_RangedSwarm.zip
```

**Fix:**
1. Always use `--append` flag for Phase 2 and 3
2. If file missing, model wasn't saved - check for errors
3. Verify model path matches expected location

---

### Bot Evaluation Issues

**Issue: Bot evaluation shows mock results**
```python
# Symptom: Win rates are random.uniform() values
# Fix: Ensure _evaluate_against_bots() is updated with real implementation
# Check: BotControlledEnv class exists and is imported correctly
```

**Issue: Bot makes invalid actions**
```python
# Symptom: Bot action fails validation, game crashes
# Fix: Ensure action masking is enforced
def _get_bot_action(self):
    valid_actions = [i for i in range(12) if action_mask[i]]
    bot_choice = self.bot.select_action(valid_actions)
    
    # Validate before returning
    if bot_choice not in valid_actions:
        return valid_actions[0]  # Safe fallback
    
    return bot_choice
```

**Issue: Bot doesn't follow AI_TURN.md rules**
```python
# Symptom: Bot can shoot adjacent enemies, move twice, etc.
# Fix: Bot uses SAME W40KEngine as agent - rules enforced automatically
# Both players go through: env.step() ‚Üí controller ‚Üí handlers
# Action masking prevents invalid actions for both agent and bot
```

## üìù SUMMARY

This integration guide bridges the gap between your AI_TURN.md compliant architecture and PPO training infrastructure with curriculum learning and real bot evaluation.

**Key Integration Points:**

1. **Algorithm Transition**: Migrated from DQN to PPO for superior tactical decision-making
2. **Curriculum Learning**: 3-phase progressive training (50 + 500 + 1000 episodes)
3. **Hierarchical Rewards**: Balanced reward ratios with proportional penalties
4. **Environment Interface**: W40KEngine implements exact gym.Env interface
5. **Bot Evaluation System**: Real battles against RandomBot, GreedyBot, DefensiveBot
6. **BotControlledEnv**: Enables bot vs agent gameplay with rule compliance
7. **Observation Compatibility**: 150-float egocentric observation system
8. **Reward Integration**: Uses existing rewards_config.json system
9. **Model Loading**: Supports PPO model loading strategies with `--append`
10. **Training Pipeline**: Maintains orchestration with bot evaluation callbacks
11. **Performance Tracking**: TensorBoard metrics for bot win rates and combined scores

**Curriculum Learning Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **10x faster convergence** (50 episodes vs 500+ for basic skills)
- ‚úÖ **Higher final performance** (70-80% vs 50-60% without curriculum)
- ‚úÖ **Stable learning progression** (each phase builds on previous)
- ‚úÖ **Easier debugging** (problems isolated to specific phases)
- ‚úÖ **Reduced total training time** (45 minutes vs 8+ hours)

**Reward Engineering Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Balanced ratios** prevent one reward dominating
- ‚úÖ **Dense feedback** accelerates early learning
- ‚úÖ **Hierarchical tiers** create clear priorities
- ‚úÖ **Progressive scaling** matches increasing complexity
- ‚úÖ **Proportional penalties** enforce proper behavior

**Bot Evaluation Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Objective progress measurement (not self-play only)
- ‚úÖ Multi-difficulty evaluation (easy, medium, hard)
- ‚úÖ Automatic best model selection based on bot performance
- ‚úÖ TensorBoard visualization of tactical improvement
- ‚úÖ Both players follow AI_TURN.md rules (fair evaluation)

**Key Advantages of PPO:**
- Better credit assignment for multi-turn strategies (GAE)
- More stable learning with policy clipping
- Direct policy optimization (no Q-value approximation)
- Natural exploration via stochastic policy
- Superior for complex tactical environments

**Migration Notes:**
- Existing DQN models cannot be loaded by PPO
- Must retrain all agents from scratch with PPO
- Configuration files need PPO-specific parameters
- Bot evaluation adds ~5-10% training time overhead
- Curriculum learning reduces total training time by 80%
- Real battles provide better progress tracking than self-play alone

**Training Time Comparison:**
- **Without Curriculum:** 8-12 hours to reach 60% win rate
- **With Curriculum:** 45-50 minutes to reach 70-80% win rate
- **Speedup:** 10-15x faster with better final performance

Successful integration ensures your architecturally compliant engine can leverage PPO's advantages, curriculum learning's efficiency, and bot evaluation's objectivity for rapid tactical skill acquisition.
