# AI TURN SEQUENCE - Ultimate Claude Understanding Guide (Streamlined)

## AI CODING CONTRACT (OPERATIONAL)

This contract constrains how any assistant or tool is allowed to modify this codebase.

- **Do not assume values**
  - If a configuration value, parameter, or input is not clearly specified in the config files or documentation, you must stop and request a specification instead of inventing a value.

- **Always raise when required data is missing**
  - Any missing critical variable, configuration key, or structural field must trigger an explicit error rather than silent substitution or skipping.

- **Do not introduce new constants inside logic**
  - Any new threshold, scaling factor, reward weight, or similar quantity must be added to the appropriate configuration file (and documented) instead of being inlined in code.

- **Always choose the simplest compliant design**
  - Prefer the smallest, clearest implementation that follows `AI_TURN.md` and `AI_IMPLEMENTATION.md`. Avoid additional layers or patterns unless they are required by those documents.

- **Refuse changes that violate AI_TURN or AI implementation rules**
  - If a requested change conflicts with the turn rules or architecture guidelines, explicitly call this out and ask for clarification instead of implementing it.

## 🧠 CORE GAME LOGIC

### Game Structure Understanding

**The Big Picture:**
- Players take **complete turns** (all 4 phases) before opponent acts
- Each phase has **specific purposes** and **different eligibility rules**
- Units act **one at a time** within each phase (sequential activation)
- Game state **changes dynamically** as units act

**Why This Structure Exists:**
- **Turn-based fairness**: Each player gets equal opportunity
- **Phase specialization**: Different tactical decisions in each phase
- **Sequential clarity**: No simultaneous action confusion
- **State consistency**: Game state remains coherent throughout

### Sequential Activation Logic

**Core Principle**: One unit completes its entire action before the next unit begins.

**Why Sequential Matters:**
- **Dynamic targeting**: Available targets change as units die
- **Position dependency**: Unit positions affect other units' options
- **Resource tracking**: Actions consume limited resources (shots, moves, etc.)
- **Tactical cascading**: One unit's action creates opportunities/threats for others

**Activation Sequence Logic:**
```
Unit Selection → Eligibility Check → Action Execution → State Update → Next Unit
```

**Key Understanding**: Eligibility is checked **when unit becomes active**, not when action executes.

### Phase Completion Logic

**Central Question**: "When does a phase end?"

**Answer**: When **no more eligible units remain** for any player.

**Why Not Step-Based**: Steps measure player actions, but phases end based on game state (unit availability).

**Logic Pattern:**
```
For Each Current Player Unit:
    Check if unit meets phase-specific eligibility criteria
    If ANY unit is eligible: Phase continues
If NO units are eligible: Phase ends, advance to next phase
```

**Claude Key Insight**: Phase transitions are **deterministic** based on unit eligibility, not arbitrary step counts.

## 📅 EPISODE & TURN CONCEPTS

### Episode Lifecycle Logic

**Episode Boundaries:**
- **Start**: First Player 0 unit begins movement (game begins)
- **End**: One player has no living units OR maximum turns reached
- **Purpose**: Complete game from start to victory/defeat condition

**Turn Progression Sequence:**
```
Turn 1: P0 Move → P0 Shoot → P0 Charge → P0 Fight → P1 Move → P1 Shoot → P1 Charge → P1 Fight
Turn 2: P0 Move (Turn++ here) → P0 Shoot → P0 Charge → P0 Fight → P1 Move → P1 Shoot → P1 Charge → P1 Fight
Turn 3: P0 Move (Turn++ here) → ...
```

**Turn Numbering Logic:**
- **Turn 1**: When Player 0 first moves
- **Turn 2**: When Player 0 moves again (after Player 1's complete turn)
- **Pattern**: Turns increment at Player 0 movement phase start

**Why P0-Centric Numbering:**
- **Consistency**: Always same player triggers turn increment
- **Clarity**: Unambiguous turn boundaries
- **Convention**: Standard in turn-based games

---

## 🏗️ STATE MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

### Single Source of Truth

**Core Principle**: Only **one game_state object** exists per game.

**State Reference Pattern:**
```
game_state ← Single authoritative object
    ↗ ↗ ↗
    │ │ └── Component C references same object
    │ └──── Component B references same object  
    └────── Component A references same object
```

**Why Single Source:**
- **Consistency**: All components see same data
- **Synchronization**: No conflicts between different state copies
- **Performance**: No expensive state copying operations
- **Debugging**: Single point of truth for state inspection

### Field Naming Logic

**Uppercase Convention**: All unit statistics use UPPERCASE field names.

**Field Categories:**
- **Movement**: MOVE, col, row
- **Shooting**: RNG_WEAPONS[], selectedRngWeaponIndex, SHOOT_LEFT
- **Fight**: CC_WEAPONS[], selectedCcWeaponIndex, ATTACK_LEFT  
- **Defense**: HP_CUR, HP_MAX, T, ARMOR_SAVE, INVUL_SAVE

**⚠️ MULTIPLE_WEAPONS_IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Units now have weapon arrays instead of single weapon fields. Use `engine.utils.weapon_helpers` functions to access weapon data.

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Must use UPPERCASE field names consistently across all components.

### Movement Restrictions Logic

**Forbidden Destinations (Cannot Move To AND through):**
- **Occupied hexes**: Other units prevent movement
- **Enemy adjacent hexes**: Adjacent to enemy = entering fight
- **Wall hexes**: Terrain blocks movement

**Why These Restrictions:**
- **Spatial logic**: Physical objects cannot overlap
- **Engagement rules**: Adjacent = fight = different phase handles it
- **Terrain realism**: Walls block movement paths

### Flee Mechanics Logic

- **Trigger**: Move action started from hex adjacent to enemy unit
- **Implementation**: `wasAdjacentToEnemy`
- **Note**: Unit automatically not adjacent at destination (move restrictions prevent adjacent destinations)
- **Why This Works**: Movement restrictions forbid destinations adjacent to enemies, so checking only the starting position is sufficient to detect flee

**Flee Consequences:**
- **Shooting phase**: Cannot shoot (disorganized from retreat)
- **Charge phase**: Cannot charge (poor position/morale)
- **Fight phase**: Can fight normally (no restriction)
- **Duration**: Until end of current turn only

**Why Flee Exists:**
- **Tactical choice**: Trade current effectiveness for survival
- **Risk/reward**: Escape death but lose capabilities
- **Strategic depth**: Creates meaningful positioning decisions

**Key Example:**
```
Wounded Marine (HP_CUR 1) adjacent to healthy Ork
Flee option: Survive to act later in the game, but lose turn effectiveness
Stay option: 80% chance of death but maintain capabilities
Decision factors: Unit value, importance of actions this turn, long term strategy, alternative threats
  ```

## 🎯 SHOOTING PHASE Decision Tree (Optimized)

**⚠️ ADVANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**: Shooting phase now supports ADVANCE action in addition to SHOOT.

## 📚 SECTION 1: GLOBAL VARIABLES & REFERENCE TABLES

### Global Variable
```javascript
weapon_rule = (weapon rules activated) ? 1 : 0
```

### Function Argument Reference Table

| Function | arg1 | arg2 | arg3 |
|----------|------|------|------|
| `valid_target_pool_build(arg1, arg2, arg3)` | weapon_rule (use weapon rules?) | advance_status: 0=no advance, 1=advanced | adjacent_status: 0=not adjacent, 1=adjacent to enemy |
| `weapon_availability_check(arg1, arg2, arg3)` | weapon_rule | advance_status: 0=no advance, 1=advanced | adjacent_status: 0=not adjacent, 1=adjacent to enemy |

**Critical Note on arg3 after Advance:** When unit has advanced (arg2=1), arg3 is ALWAYS 0 because advance restrictions prevent moving to enemy-adjacent destinations.

### End Activation Parameters Reference
```javascript
end_activation(result_type, step_count, action_type, phase, remove_from_pool, increment_step)
```
- `result_type`: ACTION | WAIT | ERROR | NO | NOT_REMOVED
- `step_count`: 0 or 1 (whether to increment episode_steps)
- `action_type`: SHOOTING | ADVANCE | MOVE | CHARGE | etc.
- `phase`: Current phase (SHOOTING)
- `remove_from_pool`: 0 or 1 (whether to remove unit from activation pool)
- `increment_step`: 0 or 1 (internal tracking)

### State Flags (CAN_SHOOT, CAN_ADVANCE)

**Determined during ELIGIBILITY CHECK:**
- `CAN_ADVANCE = true` if unit is NOT adjacent to enemy (always available)
- `CAN_ADVANCE = false` if unit IS adjacent to enemy (cannot advance when adjacent)
- `CAN_SHOOT = true` if `weapon_availability_check()` returns non-empty pool
- `CAN_SHOOT = false` if `weapon_availability_check()` returns empty pool

**Updated after advance action (if unit actually moved):**
- `CAN_ADVANCE = false` (unit has advanced, cannot advance again)
- `CAN_SHOOT = (weapon_availability_check(weapon_rule, 1, 0) returns non-empty pool)`
  - Note: Only Assault weapons available if weapon_rule=1

### UI Display Constants

**Shooting Preview Color:**
- **All players (AI and Human)**: Blue hexes (LoS and selected_weapon.RNG)

**Note**: The shooting preview displays all hexes within Line of Sight and within the selected weapon's range in blue color for both AI and Human players.

---

## 🔧 SECTION 2: CORE FUNCTIONS (Reusable Building Blocks)

### Function: player_advance()
**Purpose**: Execute advance movement for human player  
**Returns**: boolean (true if unit actually moved to different hex, false otherwise)

```javascript
player_advance():
├── Roll 1D6 → advance_range (from config: advance_distance_range)
├── Display advance_range on unit icon (bottom right)
├── Build valid_advance_destinations (BFS, advance_range, no walls, no enemy-adjacent)
├── Highlight destinations in ORANGE
├── Left click on valid advance hex → Move unit
│   └── Return: true (unit actually moved to different hex)
├── Left or Right click on the unit's icon
│   └── Return: false (unit didn't advance)
└── Remove advance icon from the unit
```

### Function: weapon_availability_check(arg1, arg2, arg3)
**Purpose**: Filter weapons based on rules and context  
**Returns**: weapon_available_pool (set of weapons that can be selected)  
**Process**: Loops through EACH ranged weapon of the unit

```javascript
weapon_availability_check(arg1, arg2, arg3):
For each weapon:
├── Check arg1 (weapon_rule):
│   ├── arg1 = 0 → No weapon rules checked/applied (continue to next check)
│   └── arg1 = 1 → Weapon rules apply (continue to next check)
├── Check arg2 (advance_status):
│   ├── arg2 = 0 → No restriction (continue to next check)
│   └── arg2 = 1 → Unit DID advance:
│       ├── arg1 = 0 → ❌ Weapon CANNOT be selectable (skip weapon)
│       └── arg1 = 1 → ✅ Weapon MUST have ASSAULT rule (continue to next check)
├── Check arg3 (adjacent_status):
│   ├── arg3 = 0 → No restriction (continue to next check)
│   └── arg3 = 1 → Unit IS adjacent to enemy:
│       ├── arg1 = 0 → ❌ Weapon CANNOT be selectable (skip weapon)
│       └── arg1 = 1 → ✅ Weapon MUST have PISTOL rule (continue to next check)
├── Check weapon.shot flag:
│   ├── weapon.shot = 0 → No restriction (continue to next check)
│   └── weapon.shot = 1 → ❌ Weapon CANNOT be selectable (skip weapon)
└── Check weapon.RNG and target availability:
    ├── weapon.RNG > 0? → NO → ❌ Weapon CANNOT be selectable (skip weapon)
    └── YES → Check if at least ONE enemy unit meets ALL conditions:
        │   Conditions (ALL must be true for at least one enemy):
        │   ├── Within weapon.RNG range (distance <= weapon.RNG)
        │   ├── In Line of Sight (no walls blocking)
        │   ├── HP_CUR > 0 (alive)
        │   └── NOT adjacent to friendly unit (excluding active unit)
        └── If NO enemy meets ALL conditions → ❌ Weapon CANNOT be selectable (skip weapon)
        └── If at least ONE enemy meets ALL conditions → ✅ Add weapon to weapon_available_pool
```

### Function: valid_target_pool_build(arg1, arg2, arg3)
**Purpose**: Build list of valid enemy targets  
**Returns**: valid_target_pool (set of enemy units that can be targeted)  
**Process**: Uses weapon_availability_check() to determine which weapons are available

```javascript
valid_target_pool_build(arg1, arg2, arg3):
For each enemy unit:
├── unit.HP_CUR > 0? → NO → Skip enemy unit
├── unit.player != current_player? → NO → Skip enemy unit
├── Unit NOT adjacent to friendly unit (excluding active unit)? → NO → Skip enemy unit
├── Unit in Line of Sight? → NO → Skip enemy unit
├── Perform weapon_availability_check(arg1, arg2, arg3) → Build weapon_available_pool
├── Unit within range of AT LEAST 1 weapon from weapon_available_pool? → NO → Skip enemy unit
└── ALL conditions met → ✅ Add unit to valid_target_pool
```

### Function: weapon_selection()
**Purpose**: Allow player to select weapon (Human only)  
**Returns**: void (updates selected_weapon and valid_target_pool)

```javascript
weapon_selection():
├── Opens weapon selection menu
├── Weapons in weapon_available_pool: displayed normally, selectable

### Function: shoot_action(target)
**Purpose**: Execute single shot sequence (unified for AI and Human)  
**Parameters**: target (AI selects best, Human clicks)  
**Returns**: void (updates SHOOT_LEFT, weapon.shot, valid_target_pool)

```javascript
shoot_action(target):
├── Execute attack_sequence(RNG)
├── Concatenate Return to TOTAL_ACTION log
├── SHOOT_LEFT -= 1
└── SHOOT_LEFT == 0 ?
    ├── YES → Current weapon exhausted:
    │   ├── Mark selected_weapon as used (remove from weapon_available_pool, set weapon.shot = 1)
    │   └── weapon_available_pool NOT empty?
    │       ├── YES → Select next available weapon:
    │       │   ├── selected_weapon = next weapon (AI/Human chooses)
    │       │   ├── SHOOT_LEFT = selected_weapon.NB
    │       │   ├── Determine context:
    │       │   │   ├── arg1 = weapon_rule
    │       │   │   ├── arg2 = (unit.id in units_advanced) ? 1 : 0
    │       │   │   └── arg3 = (unit adjacent to enemy?) ? 1 : 0
    │       │   ├── valid_target_pool_build(weapon_rule, arg2, arg3)
    │       │   └── Continue to shooting action selection step (ADVANCED if arg2=1, else normal)
    │       └── NO → All weapons exhausted → End activation
    └── NO → Continue normally (SHOOT_LEFT > 0):
        ├── selected_target dies?
        │   ├── YES → Remove from valid_target_pool:
        │   │   ├── valid_target_pool empty? → YES → End activation (Slaughter handling)
        │   │   └── NO → Continue to shooting action selection step
        │   └── NO → Target survives
        └── Final safety check: valid_target_pool empty AND SHOOT_LEFT > 0?
            ├── YES → End activation (Slaughter handling)
            └── NO → Continue to shooting action selection step
```

**Flow Control - "Continue normally":**
- **When**: After executing shot with SHOOT_LEFT > 0 remaining
- **Process**:
  1. Handle target outcome (died/survived)
  2. Update valid_target_pool (remove dead targets)
  3. Run final safety check (slaughter handling if no targets remain)
  4. Loop back to shooting action selection step
- **Purpose**: Maintain multi-shot sequence until SHOOT_LEFT = 0 or no targets remain

### Function: POSTPONE_ACTIVATION() (Human only)
**Purpose**: Allow human player to postpone unit activation  
**Trigger**: Human clicks elsewhere without shooting AND unit has NOT shot with ANY weapon

```javascript
POSTPONE_ACTIVATION():
├── Unit is NOT removed from shoot_activation_pool (can be re-activated later)
├── Remove weapon selection icon from UI
└── Return to UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK step
```

---

## 🎯 SECTION 3: PHASE FLOW (Main Decision Tree)

### STEP 1: ELIGIBILITY CHECK (Pool Building Phase)

**Purpose**: Determine which units can participate in shooting phase  
**Output**: shoot_activation_pool (set of eligible units)

```javascript
For each PLAYER unit:
├── ELIGIBILITY CHECK:
│   ├── unit.HP_CUR > 0? → NO → ❌ Skip (dead unit)
│   ├── unit.player === current_player? → NO → ❌ Skip (wrong player)
│   ├── units_fled.includes(unit.id)? → YES → ❌ Skip (fled unit)
│   ├── Adjacent to enemy unit (melee range 1 hex)?
│   │   ├── YES → 
│   │   │   ├── CAN_ADVANCE = false (cannot advance when adjacent)
│   │   │   ├── weapon_availability_check(weapon_rule, 0, 1) → Build weapon_available_pool
│   │   │   └── weapon_available_pool NOT empty?
│   │   │       ├── YES → CAN_SHOOT = true → Store unit.CAN_SHOOT = true
│   │   │       └── NO → CAN_SHOOT = false → ❌ Skip (no valid actions)
│   │   └── NO →
│   │       ├── CAN_ADVANCE = true → Store unit.CAN_ADVANCE = true
│   │       ├── weapon_availability_check(weapon_rule, 0, 0) → Build weapon_available_pool
│   │       ├── weapon_available_pool NOT empty?
│   │       │   ├── YES → CAN_SHOOT = true → Store unit.CAN_SHOOT = true
│   │       │   └── NO → CAN_SHOOT = false → Store unit.CAN_SHOOT = false
│   │       └── (CAN_SHOOT OR CAN_ADVANCE)?
│   │           ├── YES → Continue (unit has at least one valid action)
│   │           └── NO → ❌ Skip (no valid actions)
│   └── ALL conditions met → ✅ Add to shoot_activation_pool → Highlight unit with green circle
```

### STEP 2: UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK

**Purpose**: Check if there are units to activate  
**Decision Point**: Is shoot_activation_pool NOT empty?

```javascript
STEP : UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
├── shoot_activation_pool NOT empty?
│   ├── YES → Pick one unit from shoot_activation_pool:
│   │   ├── Clear valid_target_pool
│   │   ├── Clear TOTAL_ATTACK log
│   │   ├── Determine adjacency:
│   │   │   ├── Unit adjacent to enemy? → YES → unit_is_adjacent = true
│   │   │   └── NO → unit_is_adjacent = false
│   │   ├── weapon_availability_check(weapon_rule, 0, unit_is_adjacent ? 1 : 0) → Build weapon_available_pool
│   │   ├── valid_target_pool_build(weapon_rule, arg2=0, arg3=unit_is_adjacent ? 1 : 0)
│   │   └── valid_target_pool NOT empty?
│   │       ├── YES → SHOOTING ACTIONS AVAILABLE → Go to STEP 3: ACTION_SELECTION
│   │       └── NO → valid_target_pool is empty → Go to STEP 6: EMPTY_TARGET_HANDLING
│   └── NO → End of shooting phase → Advance to charge phase
```

### STEP 3: ACTION_SELECTION (Initial State - valid_target_pool NOT empty)

**Purpose**: Choose between shoot, advance, or wait  
**Context**: Unit has valid targets available

```javascript
STEP : ACTION_SELECTION (Initial State)
├── Pre-select first available weapon
├── SHOOT_LEFT = selected_weapon.NB
├── Display shooting preview: Blue hexes (LoS and selected_weapon.RNG)
├── Display HP bar blinking animation for units in valid_target_pool
├── Build VALID_ACTIONS list:
│   ├── If unit.CAN_SHOOT = true AND valid_target_pool NOT empty → Add "shoot"
│   ├── If unit.CAN_ADVANCE = true → Add "advance"
│   └── Always add "wait"
├── ❌ INVALID ACTIONS: [move, charge, attack] → end_activation(ERROR, 0, 0, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
└── Execute chosen action:
    ├── "advance" → Go to STEP 4: ADVANCE_ACTION
    ├── "shoot" → Go to STEP 5: SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION (normal)
    └── "wait" → Go to STEP 7: WAIT_ACTION
```

**AI vs Human differences:**
- **AI**: Programmatically chooses action from VALID_ACTIONS
- **Human**: Clicks UI elements (advance icon, target, weapon selection icon, or unit icon)

### STEP 4: ADVANCE_ACTION

**Purpose**: Execute advance movement  
**⚠️ POINT OF NO RETURN** (Human: Click ADVANCE logo)

```javascript
STEP : ADVANCE_ACTION
├── Roll 1D6 → advance_range (from config: advance_distance_range)
├── Display advance_range on unit icon
├── Build valid_advance_destinations (BFS, advance_range, no walls, no enemy-adjacent)
├── Select destination:
│   ├── AI: Chooses best destination
│   └── Human: Left click on valid advance hex OR left/right click on unit icon (cancel)
└── Unit actually moved to different hex?
    ├── YES → Unit advanced:
    │   ├── Mark units_advanced (add unit.id to set)
    │   ├── Log: end_activation(ACTION, 1, ADVANCE, NOT_REMOVED, 1, 0)
    │   ├── Do NOT remove from shoot_activation_pool
    │   ├── Do NOT remove green circle
    │   ├── Clear valid_target_pool
    │   ├── Update capabilities:
    │   │   ├── CAN_ADVANCE = false
    │   │   ├── weapon_availability_check(weapon_rule, 1, 0) → Build weapon_available_pool (only Assault if weapon_rule=1)
    │   │   └── CAN_SHOOT = (weapon_available_pool NOT empty)
    │   ├── Pre-select first available weapon
    │   ├── SHOOT_LEFT = selected_weapon.NB
    │   ├── valid_target_pool_build(weapon_rule, arg2=1, arg3=0) → Note: arg3=0 always after advance
    │   └── valid_target_pool NOT empty AND CAN_SHOOT = true?
    │       ├── YES → SHOOTING ACTIONS AVAILABLE (post-advance) → Go to STEP 5: ADVANCED_SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION
    │       └── NO → Unit advanced but no valid targets → end_activation(ACTION, 1, ADVANCE, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
    └── NO → Unit did not advance → Go back to STEP 3: ACTION_SELECTION
```

### STEP 5: SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION

**Purpose**: Execute shooting sequence  
**Two variants**: Normal (unit has NOT advanced) vs Advanced (post-advance state)

#### STEP 5A: SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION (Normal - unit has NOT advanced)

```javascript
STEP : SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION (Normal)
├── Display shooting preview
├── Display HP bar blinking animation
├── Human only: Display weapon selection icon (if CAN_SHOOT)
└── Action handling:
    ├── Weapon selection (Human only):
    │   ├── Left click on weapon selection icon → weapon_selection() → Return to this step
    │   └── Continue with current weapon
    ├── Shoot action:
    │   ├── AI: Select best target from valid_target_pool
    │   ├── Human: Left click on target in valid_target_pool
    │   ├── Execute shoot_action(target) → See shoot_action() function above
    │   └── After shoot_action():
    │       ├── If activation ended → Go to UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
    │       └── Else → Return to this step
    ├── Wait action (Human only):
    │   ├── Left/Right click on active_unit
    │   └── Check if unit has shot with ANY weapon (any weapon.shot = 1)?
    │       ├── YES → end_activation(ACTION, 1, SHOOTING, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
    │       └── NO → end_activation(WAIT, 1, 0, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
    └── Postpone/Click elsewhere (Human only):
        ├── Left click on another unit in shoot_activation_pool
        ├── Left/Right click anywhere else (treated as potential misclick)
        └── Check if unit has shot with ANY weapon?
            ├── NO → POSTPONE_ACTIVATION() → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
            └── YES → Do not end activation automatically (allow user to click active unit to confirm) → Return to this step
```

#### STEP 5B: ADVANCED_SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION (Post-advance state)

```javascript
STEP : ADVANCED_SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION (Post-advance)
├── Display shooting preview
├── Display HP bar blinking animation
├── Human only: Display weapon selection icon (if CAN_SHOOT)
├── 🎯 VALID ACTIONS: [shoot (if CAN_SHOOT), wait]
├── ❌ INVALID ACTIONS: [advance, move, charge, attack] → end_activation(ERROR, 0, 0, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
└── Action handling:
    ├── Weapon selection (Human only):
    │   ├── Left click on weapon selection icon → weapon_selection() → Return to this step
    │   └── Continue with current weapon
    ├── Shoot action:
    │   ├── AI: Select best target from valid_target_pool
    │   ├── Human: Left click on target in valid_target_pool
    │   ├── Execute shoot_action(target) → See shoot_action() function above
    │   └── After shoot_action():
    │       ├── If activation ended → Go to UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
    │       └── Else → Return to this step (note: still in ADVANCED state, arg2=1)
    ├── Wait action:
    │   ├── AI: Agent chooses wait
    │   ├── Human: Left/Right click on active_unit
    │   └── Check if unit has shot with ANY weapon?
    │       ├── YES → end_activation(ACTION, 1, SHOOTING, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
    │       └── NO → Unit has not shot yet (only advanced) → end_activation(ACTION, 1, ADVANCE, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
    └── Postpone/Click elsewhere (Human only):
        ├── Left click on another unit in shoot_activation_pool
        ├── Left/Right click anywhere else (treated as potential misclick)
        └── Check if unit has shot with ANY weapon?
            ├── NO → POSTPONE_ACTIVATION() → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
            └── YES → Do not end activation automatically (allow user to click active unit to confirm) → Return to this step
```

### STEP 6: EMPTY_TARGET_HANDLING (valid_target_pool is empty)

**Purpose**: Handle case when no valid targets are available  
**Context**: Unit was eligible but has no targets

```javascript
STEP : EMPTY_TARGET_HANDLING
└── unit.CAN_ADVANCE = true?
    ├── YES → Only action available is advance:
    │   ├── Display ADVANCE icon (waiting for user click)
    │   ├── Human: Click ADVANCE logo → ⚠️ POINT OF NO RETURN
    │   │   └── Execute player_advance() → Roll 1D6 → advance_range → Build destinations → unit_advanced (boolean)
    │   └── unit_advanced = true?
    │       ├── YES → end_activation(ACTION, 1, ADVANCE, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
    │       └── NO → end_activation(WAIT, 1, 0, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
    └── NO → unit.CAN_ADVANCE = false → No valid actions available:
        └── end_activation(WAIT, 1, 0, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
```

### STEP 7: WAIT_ACTION (Initial state, no shooting available)

**Purpose**: End activation without action  
**Context**: Player chooses to wait (no valid actions or player decision)

```javascript
STEP : WAIT_ACTION
├── AI: Agent chooses wait
├── Human: Player chooses wait
└── end_activation(WAIT, 1, 0, SHOOTING, 1, 1) → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
```

## 🔄 SECTION 4: FLOW SUMMARY & STEP TRANSITIONS

### Complete Step Flow
```
UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
  → ACTION_SELECTION (if valid_target_pool NOT empty)
  → [ADVANCE_ACTION | SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION | WAIT_ACTION]
  → [ADVANCED_SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION] (if advanced)
  → [EMPTY_TARGET_HANDLING] (if valid_target_pool empty)
  → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK
  → (repeat until pool empty) → End of shooting phase
```

### Key Step Transitions
- **UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK → ACTION_SELECTION**: valid_target_pool NOT empty
- **UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK → EMPTY_TARGET_HANDLING**: valid_target_pool is empty
- **ACTION_SELECTION → ADVANCE_ACTION**: Player/AI chooses advance
- **ACTION_SELECTION → SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION**: Player/AI chooses shoot
- **ACTION_SELECTION → WAIT_ACTION**: Player/AI chooses wait
- **ADVANCE_ACTION → ADVANCED_SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION**: Unit advanced AND valid_target_pool NOT empty AND CAN_SHOOT = true
- **ADVANCE_ACTION → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK**: Unit advanced but no valid targets
- **SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION → SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION**: Multi-shot sequence continues
- **SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK**: All shots fired or no targets remain
- **ADVANCED_SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION → ADVANCED_SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION**: Multi-shot sequence continues (post-advance)
- **ADVANCED_SHOOTING_ACTION_SELECTION → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK**: All shots fired or no targets remain
- **EMPTY_TARGET_HANDLING → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK**: Advance executed or wait chosen
- **WAIT_ACTION → UNIT_ACTIVABLE_CHECK**: Always (end activation)

## 📖 SECTION 5: CONCEPTUAL EXPLANATIONS

### Target Restrictions Logic

**Valid Target Requirements (ALL must be true):**
1. **Range check**: Enemy within unit's selected_weapon.RNG hexes (varies by weapon)
2. **Line of sight**: No wall hexes between shooter and target
3. **Fight exclusion**: Enemy NOT adjacent to shooter (adjacent = melee fight)
4. **Friendly fire prevention**: Enemy NOT adjacent to any friendly units

**Target becomes invalid when:**
- Enemy dies during shooting action
- Enemy moves out of range (rare during shooting phase)
- Line of sight becomes blocked (rare during shooting phase)

**Why These Restrictions:**
- **Weapon limitations**: Ranged weapons have effective range
- **Visual requirement**: Cannot shoot what cannot be seen
- **Engagement types**: Adjacent = melee fight, not shooting
- **Safety**: Prevent accidental damage to own forces

### Multiple Shots Logic

**Multi-Shot Rules:**
- **All shots in one action**: Selected ranged weapon's NB shots fired as single activation
- **Dynamic targeting**: Each shot can target different valid enemies
- **Sequential resolution**: Resolve each shot completely before next
- **Target death handling**: If target dies, remaining shots can retarget
- **Slaughter handling**: If no more "Valid target" is available, the activation ends immediately (remaining shots cancelled)

**Why Multiple Shots Work This Way:**
- **Action efficiency**: One activation covers all shots
- **Tactical flexibility**: Can spread damage across enemies
- **Realistic timing**: Rapid fire happens quickly
- **Dynamic adaptation**: React to changing battlefield

**Example 1:**
```
Marine (selected ranged weapon: NB = 2) faces two wounded Orks (both HP_CUR 1)
Shot 1: Target Ork A, kill it
Shot 2: Retarget to Ork B, kill it
Result: Eliminate two threats in one action through dynamic targeting
```

**Example 2 (Slaughter handling):**
```
Marine (selected ranged weapon: NB = 2) faces one wounded Ork (HP_CUR 1) which is the only "Valid target"
Shot 1: Target the Ork, kill it
Shot 2: No more "Valid target" available, remaining shots are cancelled
Result: Avoid a shooting unit to be stuck because it has no more "Valid target" while having remaining shots to perform
```

### Advance Distance Logic

**1D6 Roll System:**
- **When rolled**: When advance action is selected (at activation start)
- **Distance determination**: Roll determines maximum advance distance (1 to `advance_distance_range` from config)
- **Variability purpose**: Adds uncertainty and tactical risk to advance decisions

**Advance Distance Mechanics:**
- **Pathfinding**: Uses same BFS pathfinding as movement phase
- **Restrictions**: Cannot move through walls, cannot move to/through hexes adjacent to enemies
- **Destination selection**: Player/AI selects valid destination hex within rolled range
- **Marking rule**: Unit only marked as "advanced" if it actually moves to a different hex (staying in place doesn't count)

**Why Random Distance:**
- **Tactical uncertainty**: Cannot guarantee exact positioning after advance
- **Risk/reward decisions**: Longer advances closer to enemy but cannot shoot (unless Assault weapon)
- **Game balance**: Prevents guaranteed advance+shoot combinations

**Post-Advance Restrictions:**
- **Shooting**: ❌ Forbidden unless weapon has "Assault" rule
- **Charging**: ❌ Forbidden (unit marked in `units_advanced` set)
- **Fighting**: ✅ Allowed normally

**Example:**
```
Marine 5 hexes from enemy, needs to get closer to shoot
Roll 1D6 → Gets 4 (advance_distance_range = 6)
Can advance up to 4 hexes toward enemy
Decision: Advance to get within shooting range, but cannot shoot this turn (no Assault weapon)
Trade-off: Better position next turn vs losing shooting opportunity this turn
```

**Irreversibility:**
- Once advance logo clicked, unit cannot shoot (point of no return)
- Exception: Weapons with "Assault" rule allow shooting after advance
- Strategic importance: Must commit to advance before knowing exact distance

### Key Differences Between AI and Human Players

1. **Target Selection**: AI automatically chooses best target; Human clicks on target
2. **UI Display**: Both AI and Human see blue preview (see UI Display Constants above)
3. **Weapon Selection**: Human can change weapons via UI; AI pre-selects best weapon
4. **Action Selection**: AI chooses programmatically; Human clicks UI elements
5. **Postpone Logic**: Only Human can postpone activation (click elsewhere)

### Flow Control Terminology

**"Continue normally"** (in shooting context):
- **When**: After executing a shot with SHOOT_LEFT > 0 remaining
- **Meaning**: Continue the shooting sequence by:  
  1. Handling target outcome (died/survived)  
  2. Updating valid_target_pool  
  3. Running final safety check  
  4. Looping back to shooting action selection
- **Purpose**: Maintain multi-shot sequence until SHOOT_LEFT = 0 or no targets remain

### Target Restrictions Logic

**Valid Target Requirements (ALL must be true):**

1. **Range check**: Enemy within unit's selected_weapon.RNG hexes (varies by weapon)
2. **Line of sight**: No wall hexes between shooter and target
3. **Fight exclusion**: Enemy NOT adjacent to shooter (adjacent = melee fight)
4. **Friendly fire prevention**: Enemy NOT adjacent to any friendly units

**Target becomes invalid when:**
- Enemy dies during shooting action
- Enemy moves out of range (rare during shooting phase)
- Line of sight becomes blocked (rare during shooting phase)

**Why These Restrictions:**
- **Weapon limitations**: Ranged weapons have effective range
- **Visual requirement**: Cannot shoot what cannot be seen
- **Engagement types**: Adjacent = melee fight, not shooting
- **Safety**: Prevent accidental damage to own forces

### Multiple Shots Logic

**Multi-Shot Rules:**
- **All shots in one action**: Selected ranged weapon's NB shots fired as single activation
- **Dynamic targeting**: Each shot can target different valid enemies
- **Sequential resolution**: Resolve each shot completely before next
- **Target death handling**: If target dies, remaining shots can retarget
- **Slaughter handling**: If no more "Valid target" is available, the activation ends

**Why Multiple Shots Work This Way:**
- **Action efficiency**: One activation covers all shots
- **Tactical flexibility**: Can spread damage across enemies
- **Realistic timing**: Rapid fire happens quickly
- **Dynamic adaptation**: React to changing battlefield

**Example 1:**
```
Marine (selected ranged weapon: NB = 2) faces two wounded Orks (both HP_CUR 1)
Shot 1: Target Ork A, kill it
Shot 2: Retarget to Ork B, kill it
Result: Eliminate two threats in one action through dynamic targeting
```
**Example 2:**
```
Marine (selected ranged weapon: NB = 2) faces one wounded Ork (HP_CUR 1) which is the only "Valid target"
Shot 1: Target the Ork, kill it

Shot 2: No more "Valid target" available, remaining shots are cancelled
Result: Avoid a shooting unit to be stuck because it as no more "Valid target" while having remaining shots to perform

```

### Advance Distance Logic

**1D6 Roll System:**
- **When rolled**: When advance action is selected (at activation start)
- **Distance determination**: Roll determines maximum advance distance (1 to `advance_distance_range` from config)
- **Variability purpose**: Adds uncertainty and tactical risk to advance decisions

**Advance Distance Mechanics:**
- **Pathfinding**: Uses same BFS pathfinding as movement phase
- **Restrictions**: Cannot move through walls, cannot move to/through hexes adjacent to enemies
- **Destination selection**: Player/AI selects valid destination hex within rolled range
- **Marking rule**: Unit only marked as "advanced" if it actually moves to a different hex (staying in place doesn't count)

**Why Random Distance:**
- **Tactical uncertainty**: Cannot guarantee exact positioning after advance
- **Risk/reward decisions**: Longer advances closer to enemy but cannot shoot (unless Assault weapon)
- **Game balance**: Prevents guaranteed advance+shoot combinations

**Post-Advance Restrictions:**
- **Shooting**: ❌ Forbidden unless weapon has "Assault" rule
- **Charging**: ❌ Forbidden (unit marked in `units_advanced` set)
- **Fighting**: ✅ Allowed normally

**Example:**
```
Marine 5 hexes from enemy, needs to get closer to shoot
Roll 1D6 → Gets 4 (advance_distance_range = 6)
Can advance up to 4 hexes toward enemy
Decision: Advance to get within shooting range, but cannot shoot this turn (no Assault weapon)
Trade-off: Better position next turn vs losing shooting opportunity this turn
```

**Irreversibility:**
- Once advance logo clicked, unit cannot shoot (point of no return)
- Exception: Weapons with "Assault" rule allow shooting after advance
- Strategic importance: Must commit to advance before knowing exact distance

### Charge Timing Logic

**When 2d6 is Rolled**: Immediately when unit is selected by its player
**Charge roll duration**: The charge roll value is discarded at the end of the unit's activation

### Charge Distance Logic

**2D6 Roll System:**
- **When rolled**: When unit becomes eligible for charge (not when action chosen)
- **Distance determination**: Roll determines how far unit can charge this activation
- **Variability purpose**: Adds uncertainty and risk to charge decisions

**Charge Distance Mechanics:**
- **Target Detection**: Enemy units within `charge_max_distance` hexes (*via pathfinding*) are eligible charge targets
- **Roll Success**: 2D6 roll must equal or exceed distance to closest hex adjacent to target (*via pathfinding*)
- **Example**: Enemy Ork 8 hexes away, closest adjacent hex is 7 hexes away → need 7+ on 2D6 to charge
- **Why the Difference**: You charge TO a hex adjacent to the enemy, not TO the enemy itself

**Concrete Example:**

**Why Random Distance:**
- **Tactical uncertainty**: Cannot guarantee successful charges
- **Risk/reward decisions**: Longer charges more likely to fail
- **Game balance**: Prevents guaranteed charge combinations

**Example:**
```
Marine 7 hexes from the closest hex adjacent to an Ork (average charge distance)
Roll 6 or less: Charge fails (42% chance)
Roll 7+: Charge succeeds, gains fight priority (58% chance)
Decision: Weigh 42% failure risk vs fight advantage gained
```

### Charge Priority Logic

**Fight Priority Benefit:**
- **Sub-phase 1**: Charging units attack first in fight phase
- **Tactical advantage**: Can eliminate enemies before they fight back

**Why Charging Units Fight First:**
- **Momentum**: Charge gives initiative in fight
- **Tactical exposure**: Positioning for a charge often exposes the unit to deadly enemy fire during the opponent's turn
- **Risk compensation**: First strike in fight compensates for the vulnerability incurred when moving into charge position

---

## ⚔️ FIGHT PHASE LOGIC

### Fight Phase Overview

**Two-Part Structure:**
1. **Charging Priority** (Sub-phase 1): Current player's charging units attack first
2. **Alternating Fight** (Sub-phase 2): Remaining units alternate between players

**Key Principles:**
- **Charge Reward**: Successful charges grant first-strike advantage
- **Mutual Fight**: Both players' units can act (unique to fight phase)
- **Sequential Resolution**: Complete one unit's attacks before next unit acts
- **Target Validation**: Check for adjacent enemies before each attack

### Alternating Fight Tactical Considerations

**Target Priority During Alternating Phase:**

**Safe Delay Condition:**
- If ALL adjacent enemies are marked as `units_fought` → Unit can delay its attack safely
- **Why**: No risk of enemy retaliation this phase → Strategic flexibility available

**Activation and target Priority Order:**
1. **Priority 1**: Units with high melee damage output AND likely to die this phase
2. **Priority 2**: Units more likely to die (regardless of damage output)  
3. **Priority 3**: Units with high melee damage output (regardless of vulnerability) AND low chances of being destroyed this phase

**Priority Assessment Logic:**
- **"Likely to die"**: Enemy HP_CUR ≤ Expected damage from this unit's attacks
- **"High melee damage"**: Enemy CC_STR and CC_NB pose significant threat
- **"Safe targets"**: Enemies already marked as `units_fought` (cannot retaliate)

**Tactical Reasoning:**
- **Eliminate threats before they act**: Remove dangerous enemies that can still attack
- **Preserve action economy**: Attack vulnerable high-damage dealers first
- **Risk mitigation**: Prioritize survival of your own valuable units
- **Delayed gratification**: When safe, consider delaying to see how battle develops

### Fight Phase Structure Logic

**Two Sub-Phases:**
1. **Charging Units Priority**: Current player's charging units attack first
2. **Alternating Fight**: All other engaged units alternate between players

**Why Two Sub-Phases:**
- **Charge reward**: Charging units earned first strike through positioning
- **Alternating fairness**: Non-charging fight alternates for balance
- **Clear sequence**: Eliminates confusion about attack order

### Sub-Phase 1: Charging Units Logic

**Who Acts**: Current player's units marked as "charged this turn"

**Action Logic:**
- **Mandatory attacks**: Must attack if adjacent enemies exist
- **Pass if no targets**: No mark, no step increment
- **Complete all attacks**: All CC_NB attacks in one action

**Why Charging Units Go First:**
- **Earned advantage**: Successfully positioned for fight
- **Momentum bonus**: Charge provides initiative
- **Risk reward**: Compensation for charge risks taken

### Sub-Phase 2: Alternating Fight Logic

**Player Order Logic:**
- **Non-active player starts**: During P0's turn, P1 units act first
- **Then alternating**: P1 → P0 → P1 → P0 until no eligible units

**Why Non-Active Goes First:**
- **Balance compensation**: Gives slight advantage to non-active player
- **Fairness**: Offsets active player's other advantages

**Alternating Process Logic:**
```
While both players have eligible units:
    Non-active player selects and attacks with one unit
    Active player selects and attacks with one unit (no chargers)
    Repeat until one or both players have no eligible units
    
Process any remaining eligible units from either player
```

**Example:**
```
P0's turn, Fight Phase:
Sub-phase 1: P0 Marine (charged) attacks Ork first
Sub-phase 2: P1 Grot attacks P0 Scout → P0 Heavy attacks P1 Boss → Continue alternating
Result: Charging grants first strike, then fair alternation
```

## 📊 TRACKING SYSTEM LOGIC

### Tracking Purpose & Design

**Why Tracking Exists:**
- **Prevent duplicate actions**: Ensure units act only once per phase
- **Apply penalties**: Remember fled status for cross-phase restrictions
- **Enable priority systems**: Track charging for fight advantages
- **Determine phase completion**: Know when no eligible units remain

### Tracking Set Logic

**Set-Based Design Benefits:**
- **Efficient lookups**: Fast membership testing
- **Clear semantics**: Add/remove operations clearly defined
- **Consistent patterns**: Same logic structure across all phases

### Individual Tracking Sets

**units_moved** (Movement Phase):
- **Data structure**: Set containing unit IDs
- **Purpose**: Track units that have moved or waited
- **Reset timing**: Start of movement phase
- **Usage**: `units_moved` contains `unit.id` Used to identify units having shot during this turn

**units_fled** (Movement Phase):
- **Purpose**: Track units that fled from fight
- **Reset timing**: Start of movement phase (turn-level tracking)
- **Usage**: Apply shooting and charging penalties

**units_shot** (Shooting Phase):
- **Purpose**: Track units that have shot
- **Reset timing**: Start of movement phase
- **Usage**: Used to identify units having shot during this turn

**units_charged** (Charge Phase):
- **Purpose**: Track units that have charged
- **Reset timing**: Start of movement phase
- **Usage**: Fight priority determination

**units_advanced** (Shooting Phase) - ⚠️ ADVANCE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:
- **Purpose**: Track units that advanced during shooting phase
- **Reset timing**: Start of movement phase
- **Usage**: Prevents charge eligibility (advanced units cannot charge)
- **Note**: Only marked if unit actually moved (not if stayed in place)

**units_fought** (Fight Phase):
- **Purpose**: Track units that have attacked
- **Reset timing**: Start of movement phase
- **Usage**: Used to identify units having attacked during this turn

### Cross-Phase Tracking Logic

**units_fled Persistence:**
- **Spans multiple phases**: Set in movement, used in shooting and charging
- **Turn-level effect**: Cleared at start of new turn, not each phase
- **Penalty application**: Automatic ineligibility in affected phases

**charge_roll_values** (Charge Phase):
- **Purpose**: Store 2D6 roll results for units attempting charges
- **Roll timing**: Immediately when unit becomes active for charging
- **Storage format**: Map of unit.id → roll value (e.g., {unit_123: 8, unit_456: 11})
- **Usage**: Determine maximum charge distance for pathfinding validation
- **Cleanup timing**: End of unit's activation (roll discarded whether charge succeeds or fails)
- **Example**: Marine rolls 9, can charge any target within 9 hexes of adjacent positions (*via pathfinding*)

**Why Cross-Phase Tracking:**
- **Realistic consequences**: Fleeing affects unit for entire turn
- **Strategic depth**: Makes fleeing a meaningful choice with costs
- **State consistency**: Same consequences applied uniformly

**Slaughter Handling Explained:**
When all valid targets are eliminated during multi-shot action:
- Remaining shots are cancelled (cannot fire at invalid targets)
- Unit activation ends immediately
- Prevents units from being stuck with unusable remaining shots
- Maintains game flow and prevents infinite loops

## 🎪 KEY SCENARIOS

### Critical Decision Examples

**Scenario 1 - The Coordination Decision:**
```
Situation: 
- Marine A can wound high-threat Enemy (2 damage, enemy has 3 HP)
- Marine B can finish wounded enemies (2 damage)
- Enemy will kill Marine A if allowed to act

Options:
A) Marine A shoots different target, Marine B charges Enemy independently
B) Marine A wounds Enemy, Marine B finishes it with coordinated attack

Analysis:
Option A: Uncertain outcome, Enemy remains threat
Option B: Guaranteed elimination of high threat

Decision principle: Coordination often superior to individual optimization
```

**Scenario 2 - The Flee vs Fight Dilemma:**
```
Wounded Scout (HP_CUR 1) adjacent to healthy Ork
Fight prediction: 80% chance Scout dies if stays
Flee consequences: Scout survives but cannot shoot critical targets this turn

Decision factors:
- Scout's death may "lock" a high value unit in melee, preventing it from attacking a more precious unit
- Scout's flee would :
    - let him to act the subsequent turns but will "free" the ork
    - allow his allied units to shoot at the ork during the shooting phase since it will no more be adjacent to a friendly unit

Framework: Weigh certain survival vs uncertain but valuable contribution
```

**Scenario 3 - The Action Economy Challenge:**
```
Two enemies: one wounded (1 HP), one healthy (3 HP)
Unit can kill wounded enemy OR significantly wound healthy enemy

Standard approach: Kill wounded (guaranteed elimination)
Advanced consideration: What can allies accomplish?
- If ally can finish wounded in the same turn: Better to wound healthy instead
- If no ally available: Take guaranteed elimination

Principle: Optimize total force effectiveness, not individual actions
```

## 🔄 RULE INTERACTIONS

### Cross-Phase Effect Patterns

**Flee Penalty Chain:**
```
Movement phase: Unit flees (marked as fled)
Shooting phase: Fled unit cannot shoot (penalty applied)
Charge phase: Fled unit cannot charge (penalty continues)
Fight phase: Fled unit can fight normally (penalty ends)

Strategic insight: Flee penalties span multiple phases but aren't permanent
```

**Charge Priority Chain:**
```
Charge phase: Unit successfully charges
Fight sub-phase 1: Charging unit attacks first
Fight sub-phase 2: If enemy survives, alternating fight begins

Tactical advantage: First strike may eliminate enemy before retaliation
```

### Movement-Fight Interactions

**Positioning Cascade Effects:**
```
Enemy moves adjacent to your unit
Your unit faces dilemma: flee (lose effectiveness) or fight (risk death)
Decision creates ripple effects throughout remaining phases

Counter-strategy: Position units to support each other
Prevention: Avoid isolated vulnerabilities
```

## ✅ CLAUDE VALIDATION POINTS

### Fundamental Understanding Checks

**Can Claude answer these core questions?**

1. **"Who can act in Movement phase?"** 
   - Correct: Only current player's units
   - Why: Phase-based turn system

2. **"When does Shooting phase end?"**
   - Correct: When no current player units are eligible to shoot
   - Why: Eligibility-based phase completion

3. **"Why can't fled units charge?"**
   - Correct: They're too far from fight and demoralized
   - Why: Logical consequence of retreat action

4. **"What makes Fight phase unique?"**
   - Correct: Both players' units can act (only such phase)
   - Why: Fight involves units from both sides

### Rule Application Checks

**Can Claude correctly apply eligibility logic?**

Given a unit that is:
- Alive (HP_CUR > 0) ✓
- Belongs to current player ✓  
- Not in units_moved ✓
- Adjacent to an enemy

**Movement phase eligibility**: ELIGIBLE (adjacency doesn't prevent movement)
**Shooting phase eligibility**: INELIGIBLE (adjacent = in fight = cannot shoot)

### Sequence Understanding Checks

**Can Claude trace phase progression?**

Starting state: P0 Movement phase, Turn 1
After P0 completes all phases and P1 completes all phases:
Expected result: P0 Movement phase, Turn 2

**When Turn increments**: Turn increments when P0 starts Movement (turn-based on P0)

### Error Detection Checks

**Can Claude identify common mistakes?**

Scenario: "Unit perform the shoot action, then in same phase performs the same action again"
Claude should identify: VIOLATION - units_shot tracking prevents duplicate actions

Scenario: "Unit moves to hex adjacent to enemy, then shoots in same turn"
Claude should identify: VIOLATION - Movement restrictions prevent moving TO hexes adjacent to enemies

Scenario: "Unit moves from adjacent to enemy to non-adjacent hex, then shoots in same turn"
Claude should identify: VIOLATION - Fled penalty prevents fled units from shooting in the same turn

Scenario: "Unit charges from adjacent to enemy to a different adjacent hex"
Claude should identify: VIOLATION - No charge allowed for units adjacent to enemy units

## 🎯 DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Universal Eligibility Pattern

**For any unit in any phase:**
```
1. Check basic viability (alive, correct player)
2. Check action restrictions (already acted, penalties)  
3. Check opportunity availability (valid targets/destinations)
4. Return eligibility result with reason
```

**Why This Pattern:**
- **Consistent**: Same logic structure across all phases
- **Efficient**: Most restrictive checks first
- **Informative**: Provides reason for ineligibility
- **Debuggable**: Clear failure points

### Action Resolution Pattern

**For eligible unit choosing action:**
```
1. Validate action preconditions
2. Execute action atomically  
3. Update game state (positions, health, etc.)
4. Update tracking sets (mark as acted)
5. Log action for replay/debugging
6. Check for consequent state changes (death, phase completion)
```

**Why This Pattern:**
- **Atomic**: Complete action or no action (no partial states)
- **Traceable**: All changes logged
- **Consistent**: Same pattern regardless of action type
- **Complete**: Handles all necessary state updates

### Phase Transition Pattern

**For current phase:**
```
1. Identify all potentially eligible units (current player)
2. Check each unit's phase-specific eligibility
3. If any eligible units found: Continue phase
4. If no eligible units found: Advance to next phase
5. Reset appropriate tracking sets for new phase
```

**Why This Pattern:**
- **Deterministic**: Clear rules for when phases end
- **Complete**: Checks all units, not just some
- **State-based**: Transitions based on game state, not arbitrary rules
- **Clean**: Proper cleanup between phases
