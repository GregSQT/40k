- **BotControlledEnv**: Wrapper enabling bot vs agent evaluation battles
- **Evaluation Bots**: RandomBot, GreedyBot, DefensiveBot for measuring progress
- **Reward System**: Configuration-driven reward calculation from `rewards_config.json`
- **Curriculum Phases**: Progressive training phases (phase1, phase2, phase3) for efficient learning
- **Unified Metrics**: All metrics written to single TensorBoard directory via model.logger
- **Optimization Strategy**: Metrics-driven hyperparameter adjustment guidelines
- **Model Persistence**: Trained models saved as `.zip` files with embedded parameters

### Why PPO for Tactical Combat

PPO is superior to DQN for turn-based tactical games like Warhammer 40K:

**PPO Advantages:**
1. **Policy Gradient Method**: Directly optimizes the policy (action selection), better for complex tactical decisions
2. **On-Policy Learning**: Learns from current policy, more stable for sequential turn-based gameplay
3. **Clipped Updates**: Prevents destructive policy changes, crucial for maintaining learned tactics
4. **Better Credit Assignment**: GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation) handles delayed rewards from multi-turn strategies
5. **Stable Convergence**: Less prone to catastrophic forgetting of successful tactics

**Why Not DQN:**
- Off-policy learning can be unstable with sparse rewards
- Q-value estimation struggles with large action spaces
- Exploration via epsilon-greedy is crude for tactical decisions
- Harder to handle multi-step planning

### Training Flow Understanding
```python
# PPO training loop with curriculum
for episode in range(episodes):
    obs = env.reset()  # Get initial game state
    while not done:
        action, _ = model.predict(obs)  # AI chooses action via policy
        obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)  # Execute action
        # PPO learns from: trajectory of (obs, action, reward, value) tuples
        # Updates policy after collecting n_steps experiences
    
    # Every 5000 steps: Bot evaluation
    if step % 5000 == 0:
        test_vs_RandomBot()    # 20 episodes → win rate
        test_vs_GreedyBot()    # 20 episodes → win rate  
        test_vs_DefensiveBot() # 20 episodes → win rate
        # Save best model based on combined performance
```

## 📚 CURRICULUM LEARNING (3-PHASE TRAINING)

### Overview

**Curriculum learning** progressively increases task difficulty, allowing the agent to master simpler skills before tackling complex tactical decisions.

**Why Curriculum Learning?**
- ✅ **Faster convergence**: Agent learns basic skills in 50 episodes vs 500+ with direct training
- ✅ **Stable learning**: Each phase builds on previous learned behaviors
- ✅ **Better final performance**: Foundational skills transfer to complex scenarios
- ✅ **Reduced training time**: 1-2 hours total vs 8+ hours for direct training
- ✅ **Easier debugging**: Problems isolated to specific learning phases

**Training Progression:**
```
Phase 1 (50 episodes)  → Phase 2 (500 episodes) → Phase 3 (1000 episodes)
Learn: Shooting        → Learn: Priorities     → Learn: Full Tactics
Win Rate: 40-50%       → Win Rate: 60-70%      → Win Rate: 70-80%
```

### Phase 1: Learn Shooting Basics

**🎯 Goal:** Teach agent that **shooting is better than waiting**

**Training Duration:** 50 episodes (~2 minutes with debug config)

**Key Concepts:**
- Basic action selection (shoot vs wait vs move)
- Understanding rewards from combat results
- Learning that kills give big rewards

**Reward Configuration (`phase1`):**
```json
{
  "base_actions": {
    "ranged_attack": 5.0,    // ⭐⭐⭐ High reward for shooting
    "move_to_los": 0.8,      // ⭐ Small reward for positioning
    "wait": -5.0             // ❌❌❌ Strong penalty for waiting
  },
  "result_bonuses": {
    "hit_target": 1.0,       // ✅ Immediate feedback
    "wound_target": 2.0,     // ✅ Progress reward
    "damage_target": 3.0,    // ✅ More progress
    "kill_target": 10.0      // ⭐⭐⭐ Big bonus for kill
  },
  "situational_modifiers": {
    "win": 30.0,             // Moderate win bonus
    "lose": -30.0,
    "friendly_fire_penalty": -10.0,  // Strong penalty
    "attack_wasted": -3.0,   // Discourage overkill
    "no_targets_penalty": -2.0
  }
}
```

**Hyperparameters (`phase1` training config):**
```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.001,    // High LR for fast initial learning
  "n_steps": 512,            // Small rollout buffer
  "batch_size": 32,          // Small batches
  "ent_coef": 0.20,          // High exploration (20%)
  "policy_kwargs": {
    "net_arch": [128, 128]   // Small network
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Episodes 1-20:** Random exploration, tries all actions
- **Episodes 20-35:** Starts preferring shooting over waiting
- **Episodes 35-50:** Consistently shoots when targets available (80%+ of time)

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Agent uses shoot actions (4-8) in >80% of shooting phases
- ✅ Wait frequency <20%
- ✅ Win rate >40%
- ✅ Zero invalid actions

**Common Issues:**
- **Agent still waits often:** Increase `wait` penalty to -7.0
- **Win rate <30%:** Check observation space - agent might not see targets correctly
- **Invalid actions:** Action masking not enforced - check W40KEngine implementation

---

### Phase 2: Learn Target Priorities

**🎯 Goal:** Teach agent to **prioritize weak targets** (finish kills)

**Training Duration:** 500 episodes (~8 minutes with debug config, ~25 minutes with full config)

**Key Concepts:**
- Target selection strategies (low HP vs high HP)
- Understanding kill efficiency (finishing vs spreading damage)
- Learning focus fire tactics

**Reward Configuration (`phase2`):**
```json
{
  "base_actions": {
    "ranged_attack": 3.0,    // ⭐⭐ Moderate shoot reward
    "move_to_los": 0.5,      // Small positioning reward
    "wait": -3.0             // ❌❌ Moderate wait penalty
  },
  "result_bonuses": {
    "hit_target": 1.0,
    "wound_target": 2.0,
    "damage_target": 3.0,
    "kill_target": 15.0      // ⭐⭐⭐ HIGHER kill bonus
  },
  "situational_modifiers": {
    "win": 50.0,             // Higher win bonus
    "lose": -50.0,
    "target_lowest_hp": 8.0, // ⭐⭐⭐ NEW: Prioritize weak enemies
    "friendly_fire_penalty": -15.0,
    "attack_wasted": -5.0,   // Higher overkill penalty
    "no_targets_penalty": -3.0
  }
}
```

**Hyperparameters (`phase2` training config):**
```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.0003,   // Lower LR for stable refinement
  "n_steps": 1024,           // Larger rollout buffer
  "batch_size": 64,          // Medium batches
  "ent_coef": 0.05,          // Medium exploration (5%)
  "policy_kwargs": {
    "net_arch": [256, 256]   // Larger network
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Episodes 1-100:** Continues shooting preference from Phase 1
- **Episodes 100-250:** Starts targeting damaged enemies more often
- **Episodes 250-400:** Consistent focus fire on weak targets (60%+ of time)
- **Episodes 400-500:** Advanced tactics - recognizes when to finish vs when to spread damage

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Win rate >60%
- ✅ Agent targets lowest HP enemy in 60%+ of cases
- ✅ Kill-to-damage ratio improves (fewer "spread damage" patterns)
- ✅ Wait frequency <10%

**Common Issues:**
- **Random target selection:** Increase `target_lowest_hp` bonus to 10.0
- **Win rate plateaus at 50%:** Check if observation includes target HP correctly
- **Reverts to Phase 1 behavior:** Used `--new` instead of `--append` - lost Phase 1 training

---

### Phase 3: Learn Full Tactics

**🎯 Goal:** Teach agent **complete tactical repertoire** (positioning, cover, timing)

**Training Duration:** 1000 episodes (~15 minutes with debug config, ~45 minutes with full config)

**Key Concepts:**
- Movement for Line of Sight (LOS)
- Cover usage and positioning
- Turn timing (when to wait strategically)
- Multi-turn planning

**Reward Configuration (`phase3`):**
```json
{
  "base_actions": {
    "ranged_attack": 2.0,    // ⭐ Baseline shoot reward
    "move_to_los": 1.5,      // ⭐⭐ Higher positioning reward
    "wait": -1.0             // ❌ Small wait penalty (sometimes strategic)
  },
  "result_bonuses": {
    "hit_target": 1.0,
    "wound_target": 2.0,
    "damage_target": 3.0,
    "kill_target": 20.0      // ⭐⭐⭐ Maximum kill bonus
  },
  "situational_modifiers": {
    "win": 100.0,            // ⭐⭐⭐ Maximum win bonus
    "lose": -100.0,
    "target_lowest_hp": 10.0,
    "in_cover_bonus": 5.0,   // ⭐⭐ NEW: Reward good positioning
    "tactical_advance": 3.0, // ⭐ NEW: Reward smart movement
    "friendly_fire_penalty": -20.0,
    "attack_wasted": -8.0,
    "no_targets_penalty": -5.0
  }
}
```

**Hyperparameters (`phase3` training config):**
```json
{
  "learning_rate": 0.0001,   // Low LR for fine-tuning
  "n_steps": 2048,           // Large rollout buffer
  "batch_size": 128,         // Large batches
  "ent_coef": 0.01,          // Low exploration (1%) - exploit learned tactics
  "policy_kwargs": {
    "net_arch": [256, 256, 128]   // Deep network
  }
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- **Episodes 1-200:** Maintains Phase 2 target priority skills
- **Episodes 200-500:** Starts using movement actions more strategically
- **Episodes 500-800:** Uses cover and positioning consistently
- **Episodes 800-1000:** Advanced tactics - flanking, kiting, timing optimization

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ Win rate >70%
- ✅ Movement actions used strategically (not random wandering)
- ✅ Agent survives longer (fewer units lost)
- ✅ Beats GreedyBot >50% of time
- ✅ Beats DefensiveBot >40% of time

**Common Issues:**
- **Win rate oscillates wildly:** Learning rate too high - reduce to 0.00005
- **Agent stops moving:** Movement rewards too low - increase `move_to_los` to 2.5
- **Overfits to training scenarios:** Need more diverse scenarios in scenario.json

### Reward Engineering Philosophy

**Hierarchical Reward Design:**

Rewards are structured in **tiers** to create clear behavioral priorities:

**Tier 1: Terminal Outcomes** (Highest magnitude)
- Win: +100.0
- Lose: -100.0
- **Purpose:** Ultimate goal signal

**Tier 2: Critical Events** (High magnitude)
- Kill target: +20.0
- Friendly fire: -20.0
- **Purpose:** Major tactical milestones

**Tier 3: Progress Indicators** (Medium magnitude)
- Damage target: +3.0
- Target selection bonuses: +8.0 to +10.0
- **Purpose:** Intermediate success signals

**Tier 4: Action Encouragement** (Low magnitude)
- Shoot action: +2.0
- Move action: +1.5
- Wait penalty: -1.0
- **Purpose:** Basic behavior shaping

**Tier 5: Minor Feedback** (Very low magnitude)
- Hit target: +1.0
- No targets penalty: -5.0
- **Purpose:** Fine-grained feedback

**Key Principle:** **Ratio Preservation**
- Terminal outcomes = 5x critical events
- Critical events = 5-7x progress indicators
- Progress indicators = 2-3x action encouragement
- This prevents any single reward dominating learning

---

### Common Reward Design Mistakes

**❌ Mistake #1: Dense Rewards with Equal Magnitudes**
```json
{
  "ranged_attack": 1.0,
  "hit_target": 1.0,      // Same as shoot action!
  "wound_target": 1.0,    // Same as hit!
  "kill_target": 1.0      // Same as wound! NO HIERARCHY
}
```
**Problem:** Agent can't distinguish important events from minor ones
**Fix:** Use hierarchical scaling: shoot=2.0, hit=1.0, wound=2.0, kill=20.0

---

**❌ Mistake #2: Sparse Rewards Only**
```json
{
  "win": 1.0,
  "lose": -1.0
  // NO intermediate rewards
}
```
**Problem:** Agent gets zero feedback until game ends - learns slowly
**Fix:** Add progress rewards for hits, wounds, kills

---

**❌ Mistake #3: Penalties Stronger Than Rewards**
```json
{
  "ranged_attack": 1.0,
  "friendly_fire_penalty": -50.0  // 50x stronger than shoot reward!
}
```
**Problem:** Agent becomes paralyzed with fear - won't shoot at all
**Fix:** Keep penalties proportional: friendly_fire=-10.0 (5x shoot reward)

---

**❌ Mistake #4: No Action Baseline Rewards**
```json
{
  "kill_target": 10.0
  // No reward for "ranged_attack" action itself
}
```
**Problem:** Agent doesn't learn to shoot until it gets lucky kill
**Fix:** Add small base action rewards: ranged_attack=2.0

---

## 🤖 BOT EVALUATION SYSTEM

### Evaluation Bot Architecture

**Purpose:** Provide **objective, difficulty-scaled performance measurement** separate from self-play training.

**Why Evaluation Bots?**
- ✅ **Objective progress tracking** - Not biased by self-play dynamics
- ✅ **Multi-difficulty assessment** - Test against easy, medium, hard opponents
- ✅ **Comparable benchmarks** - Win rates vs bots are consistent across training runs
- ✅ **Early problem detection** - If agent can't beat RandomBot, something is very wrong
- ✅ **Fair evaluation** - Both players follow exact same AI_TURN.md rules

**Bot Types:**
1. **RandomBot** (Easy) - Random valid action selection
2. **GreedyBot** (Medium) - Greedy target selection, basic tactics
3. **DefensiveBot** (Hard) - Advanced positioning and defensive play

---

### Bot Behaviors and Difficulty

#### RandomBot (Difficulty: Easy)
```python
class RandomBot:
    def select_action(self, valid_actions: List[int]) -> int:
        """Randomly select from valid actions."""
        return random.choice(valid_actions)
```

**Behavior:**
- Completely random valid action selection
- No strategic planning
- No target prioritization
- **Expected Win Rate:** Agent should beat RandomBot 70%+ by Phase 2

---

#### GreedyBot (Difficulty: Medium)
```python
class GreedyBot:
    def select_action_with_state(self, valid_actions: List[int], game_state: Dict) -> int:
        """Greedy target selection - always shoots lowest HP enemy."""
        # Prefer shoot actions (4-8)
        shoot_actions = [a for a in valid_actions if 4 <= a <= 8]
        
        if shoot_actions:
            # Find target with lowest HP
            targets = game_state['units']['player_1']
            weakest = min(targets, key=lambda u: u['HP_CUR'])
            return shoot_actions[0]  # Shoot weakest
        
        # Fallback to first valid action
        return valid_actions[0]
```

**Behavior:**
- Always targets lowest HP enemy
- Prefers shooting over waiting
- Basic focus fire strategy
- No movement or positioning strategy
- **Expected Win Rate:** Agent should beat GreedyBot 50%+ by Phase 3

---

#### DefensiveBot (Difficulty: Hard)
```python
class DefensiveBot:
    def select_action_with_state(self, valid_actions: List[int], game_state: Dict) -> int:
        """Advanced defensive play with positioning awareness."""
        my_units = game_state['units']['player_0']
        enemy_units = game_state['units']['player_1']
        
        # Check if in danger
        if self._under_threat(my_units, enemy_units):
            # Prioritize movement to cover
            move_actions = [a for a in valid_actions if a == 3]
            if move_actions:
                return move_actions[0]
        
        # If safe, target weakest enemy that threatens most
        shoot_actions = [a for a in valid_actions if 4 <= a <= 8]
        if shoot_actions:
            threat_target = self._find_biggest_threat(enemy_units, my_units)
            return shoot_actions[0]
        
        # Fallback
        return valid_actions[0]
    
    def _under_threat(self, my_units, enemy_units) -> bool:
        """Check if any friendly unit is in danger."""
        for unit in my_units:
            if unit['HP_CUR'] < unit['HP_MAX'] * 0.5:
                return True
        return False
    
    def _find_biggest_threat(self, enemies, friendlies):
        """Find enemy that poses biggest threat."""
        # Score enemies by: (damage output) * (low HP = high priority to kill)
        # Implementation details...
        pass
```

**Behavior:**
- Threat awareness (defensive positioning)
- Target prioritization based on danger assessment
- Cover usage when damaged
- Strategic retreat when overwhelmed
- **Expected Win Rate:** Agent should beat DefensiveBot 40%+ by end of Phase 3

---

### Real Battle Implementation

**BotControlledEnv Wrapper:**

```python
class BotControlledEnv:
    """Wrapper enabling bot to control Player 1 during evaluation."""
    
    def __init__(self, base_env, bot, unit_registry):
        self.base_env = base_env
        self.bot = bot
        self.unit_registry = unit_registry
        # Unwrap ActionMasker to access W40KEngine
        self.engine = base_env.env if hasattr(base_env, 'env') else base_env
    
    def step(self, agent_action):
        current_player = self.engine.game_state["current_player"]
        
        if current_player == 0:
            # Agent's turn - execute their action
            return self.base_env.step(agent_action)
        else:
            # Bot's turn - get bot action and execute
            bot_action = self._get_bot_action()
            obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = self.base_env.step(bot_action)
            return obs, 0.0, terminated, truncated, info  # Zero reward for bot turns
    
    def _get_bot_action(self) -> int:
        """Get valid bot action following AI_TURN.md rules."""
        game_state = self.engine.game_state
        action_mask = self.engine.get_action_mask()
        valid_actions = [i for i in range(12) if action_mask[i]]
        
        if not valid_actions:
            return 11  # Wait action as fallback
        
        # Call bot's action selection
        if hasattr(self.bot, 'select_action_with_state'):
            bot_choice = self.bot.select_action_with_state(valid_actions, game_state)
        else:
            bot_choice = self.bot.select_action(valid_actions)
        
        # Validate bot action
        if bot_choice not in valid_actions:
            return valid_actions[0]  # Safe fallback
        
        return bot_choice
```

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Rule Compliance:** Bot actions go through same W40KEngine validation as agent
- ✅ **Action Masking:** Bot can only select valid actions
- ✅ **Fair Evaluation:** Both players use identical game engine and rules
- ✅ **Zero Bot Rewards:** Bot turns don't affect agent's training signal

**BotEvaluationCallback:**

```python
class BotEvaluationCallback(BaseCallback):
    """Evaluate agent against bots every N steps."""
    
    def __init__(self, eval_freq: int = 5000, n_eval_episodes: int = 20):
        super().__init__()
        self.eval_freq = eval_freq
        self.n_eval_episodes = n_eval_episodes
        self.best_combined_score = 0.0
    
    def _on_step(self) -> bool:
        if self.n_calls % self.eval_freq == 0:
            results = self._evaluate_against_bots()

## 📊 METRICS SYSTEM

### Actual Metrics Implementation

**CRITICAL:** All metrics are written to a **SINGLE TensorBoard directory** (e.g., `./tensorboard/PPO_1/`) to ensure unified monitoring and prevent directory mismatches.

#### **Implementation Architecture**

```python
# SB3 automatically creates: ./tensorboard/PPO_1/
# All metrics write to model.logger → same directory

# Callback writes game_critical metrics directly to model.logger
self.model.logger.record('game_critical/episode_reward', total_reward)
self.model.logger.dump(step=self.model.num_timesteps)

# Result: All metrics appear in same TensorBoard event file
```

## 📈 METRICS OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY

### Phase-Specific Success Criteria

#### Phase 1: Shooting Basics (Episodes 1-50)

**Primary Metrics (check every 10 episodes):**
- ✅ `game_critical/win_rate_100ep` > 40% by episode 50
- ✅ `train/explained_variance` > 0.70 by episode 30
- ✅ `game_critical/invalid_action_rate` = 0%

**Secondary Metrics:**
- `train/approx_kl` < 0.02 (stable learning)
- `train/clip_fraction` 15-30% (healthy exploration)
- `train/entropy_loss` decreasing gradually

**If Win Rate < 40% at Episode 50:**

1. **Check `game_critical/episode_reward` trend:**
   - **Flat/decreasing** → Increase shoot reward (+2.0) in rewards_config.json
   - **Increasing but slow** → Increase wait penalty (-2.0) in rewards_config.json

2. **Check `train/explained_variance`:**
   - **< 0.60** → Network too small, increase to [256, 256] in training_config.json
   - **> 0.80 but low win rate** → Reward balance issue, check reward ratios

3. **Check `train/entropy_loss`:**
   - **Near zero too early** → Increase ent_coef from 0.20 to 0.30 (more exploration)
   - **Still high (> -1.0)** → Policy not converging, check observation space

**Action Plan Example:**
```bash
# Episode 50: Win rate stuck at 32%
# Diagnosis: explained_variance = 0.58 (too low)

# Fix: Increase network size
# Edit: config/training_config.json → phase1 → policy_kwargs
"net_arch": [256, 256]  # Changed from [128, 128]

# Retrain Phase 1 with --new flag
python ai/train.py --agent SpaceMarine_Infantry_Troop_RangedSwarm --training-config phase1 --new
```

---

#### Phase 2: Target Priorities (Episodes 51-550)

**Primary Metrics (check every 50 episodes):**
- ✅ `game_critical/win_rate_100ep` > 60% by episode 300
- ✅ `eval_bots/vs_random_bot` > 0.70 by episode 400
- ✅ `game_critical/units_killed_vs_lost_ratio` > 1.2

**Secondary Metrics:**
- `train/explained_variance` > 0.85
- `train/approx_kl` < 0.015 (more stable than Phase 1)
- `eval_bots/combined_score` improving

**Optimization Triggers:**

**Trigger 1: Win rate plateaus at 55% (episodes 200-300)**
- **Diagnosis:** Agent not prioritizing weak targets
- **Check:** Review episode replays - does agent shoot random targets?
- **Fix:** Increase `target_lowest_hp` bonus from 8.0 to 12.0

**Trigger 2: Kill ratio < 1.0 (losing more units than killing)**
- **Diagnosis:** Poor target selection or positioning
- **Check:** `game_critical/episode_length` - if too long (>60 steps), agent not finishing kills
- **Fix:** Increase `kill_target` bonus from 15.0 to 25.0

**Trigger 3: High reward variance (TensorBoard shows jagged `episode_reward`)**
- **Diagnosis:** Policy changing too fast
- **Check:** `train/approx_kl` - if > 0.02, learning rate too high
- **Fix:** Reduce learning rate from 0.0003 to 0.0001

**Action Plan Example:**
```bash
# Episode 300: Win rate stuck at 53%, kill ratio = 0.95
# Diagnosis: Not prioritizing weak targets, spreading damage

# Fix 1: Increase priority bonus
# Edit: config/rewards_config.json → phase2 → situational_modifiers
"target_lowest_hp": 12.0  # Changed from 8.0

# Fix 2: Increase kill bonus
"kill_target": 25.0  # Changed from 15.0

# Continue training with --append
python ai/train.py --agent SpaceMarine_Infantry_Troop_RangedSwarm --training-config phase2 --append
```

---

#### Phase 3: Full Tactics (Episodes 551-1550)

**Primary Metrics (check every 100 episodes):**
- ✅ `game_critical/win_rate_100ep` > 70% by episode 1200
- ✅ `eval_bots/vs_defensive_bot` > 0.50
- ✅ `train/approx_kl` < 0.015 (stable convergence)

**Secondary Metrics:**
- `eval_bots/vs_greedy_bot` > 0.60
- `train/explained_variance` > 0.90
- `game_critical/episode_length` stable (not increasing)

**When to Stop Early:**
- ✅ Win rate > 80% for 100 consecutive episodes
- ✅ All bot win rates > 70%
- ✅ Explained variance > 0.95 + stable rewards (no improvement for 200 episodes)

**Optimization Triggers:**

**Trigger 1: Win rate > 70% vs RandomBot but < 40% vs DefensiveBot**
- **Diagnosis:** Agent overfitting to weak opponents, lacks defensive tactics
- **Check:** `eval_bots/vs_defensive_bot` trend
- **Fix:** Increase positioning rewards (`in_cover_bonus`, `tactical_advance`)

**Trigger 2: Win rate oscillates 60-80% (unstable)**
- **Diagnosis:** Policy updates too aggressive
- **Check:** `train/clip_fraction` - if > 40%, too many large updates
- **Fix:** Reduce learning rate AND reduce clip_range (0.2 → 0.15)

**Trigger 3: Episode length increasing (>70 steps) despite high win rate**
- **Diagnosis:** Agent playing too conservatively
- **Check:** Action distribution in replays - is agent waiting too much?
- **Fix:** Reduce wait penalty (-1.0 → -0.5) OR increase aggression rewards

**Action Plan Example:**
```bash
# Episode 1000: Win rate 72%, but vs_defensive_bot only 35%
# Diagnosis: Lacks defensive positioning, charges recklessly

# Fix: Increase positioning rewards
# Edit: config/rewards_config.json → phase3 → situational_modifiers
"in_cover_bonus": 8.0       # Changed from 5.0
"tactical_advance": 5.0     # Changed from 3.0

# Continue training
python ai/train.py --agent SpaceMarine_Infantry_Troop_RangedSwarm --training-config phase3 --append
```

```

---

#### **Bad Learning Patterns** ❌

**Pattern 1: Plateau (Stuck)**
```
Episodes 20-50:
  win_rate:      30% → 31% → 32% → 31% → 32% (STUCK)
  explained_var: 0.58 → 0.60 → 0.61 → 0.60 → 0.61 (NOT IMPROVING)
  episode_reward: 8.5 → 8.7 → 8.9 → 8.6 → 8.8 (FLAT)
```
**Root Cause:** Network capacity too small OR rewards too sparse
**Symptoms:**
- Win rate stuck below target for 30+ episodes
- Explained variance < 0.70 and not improving
- Reward values plateau

**Fix:**
1. Increase network size: [128, 128] → [256, 256]
2. Add more dense rewards (intermediate progress signals)
3. Increase exploration: ent_coef 0.20 → 0.30

---

**Pattern 2: Oscillation (Unstable)**
```
Episodes 300-350:
  win_rate:      55% → 62% → 48% → 70% → 45% → 68% (WILD SWINGS)
  approx_kl:     0.025 → 0.035 → 0.028 → 0.042 → 0.031 (TOO HIGH)
  clip_fraction: 0.45 → 0.52 → 0.48 → 0.55 → 0.50 (TOO MUCH CLIPPING)
```
**Root Cause:** Learning rate too high, policy changing too fast
**Symptoms:**
- Win rate swings >15% between evaluations
- `approx_kl` frequently > 0.03
- `clip_fraction` consistently > 40%

**Fix:**
1. Reduce learning rate by 50%: 0.0003 → 0.00015
2. Reduce clip range: 0.2 → 0.15
3. Increase batch size: 64 → 128 (more stable gradients)

---

**Pattern 3: Overfitting (Self-Play Bias)**
```
Episodes 800-1000:
  win_rate (self-play):  78% → 80% → 82% → 83% (GREAT)
  vs_random_bot:         0.82 → 0.84 → 0.85 → 0.86 (GREAT)
  vs_greedy_bot:         0.45 → 0.43 → 0.41 → 0.38 (DECLINING!)
  vs_defensive_bot:      0.28 → 0.25 → 0.23 → 0.20 (WORSE!)
```
**Root Cause:** Agent overfitting to random opponent, not generalizing
**Symptoms:**
- High self-play win rate but poor bot evaluation
- Performance vs harder bots declining
- Agent has "blind spots" in tactics

**Fix:**
1. Need more diverse training scenarios
2. Adjust rewards to encourage defensive play
3. Increase bot evaluation frequency to catch overfitting early

---

**Pattern 4: Early Collapse (Entropy Death)**
```
Episodes 5-15:
  entropy_loss:  -2.0 → -1.0 → -0.3 → -0.1 → -0.05 (COLLAPSED TOO FAST)
  win_rate:      22% → 25% → 28% → 28% → 28% (STUCK)
  clip_fraction: 0.05 → 0.03 → 0.02 → 0.02 (NO EXPLORATION)
```
**Root Cause:** Policy became deterministic too early, stuck in local optimum
**Symptoms:**
- Entropy near zero within 20 episodes
- Win rate improves slightly then plateaus
- Clip fraction very low (policy not changing)

**Fix:**
1. Increase entropy coefficient: 0.01 → 0.10
2. Restart training with higher exploration
3. Check if initial policy is biased (bad initialization)

---

### Hyperparameter Adjustment Guide

**Based on Metric Patterns:**

| Metric Pattern | Root Cause | Solution | Config Change |

| `approx_kl` > 0.03 consistently | Learning too fast | Reduce learning rate | `learning_rate`: 0.001 → 0.0003 |
| `clip_fraction` < 10% | Updates too conservative | Increase clip range | `clip_range`: 0.2 → 0.3 |
| `clip_fraction` > 50% | Policy changing drastically | Reduce LR + clip range | `learning_rate`: ÷2, `clip_range`: 0.2 → 0.15 |
| `entropy_loss` near 0 early | Collapsed to deterministic | Increase exploration | `ent_coef`: 0.01 → 0.10 |
| Win rate flat + low entropy | Stuck in local optimum | Increase exploration OR reset | `ent_coef`: +0.05 OR restart |
| High reward variance | Policy unstable | Increase batch size | `batch_size`: 64 → 128 |
| `value_loss` not decreasing | Value function failing | Increase VF coefficient | `vf_coef`: 0.5 → 1.0 |
| Bot eval declining | Overfitting | More diverse scenarios | Add scenarios to scenario.json |
| `episode_length` increasing | Too conservative | Reduce wait penalty | `wait`: -1.0 → -0.5 |

### Early Stopping Criteria

**Stop Training When (SUCCESS - any of):**

1. ✅ **Win Rate Target Achieved**
   - `game_critical/win_rate_100ep` > 80% for 100 consecutive episodes
   - Indicates strong general performance

2. ✅ **Bot Evaluation Excellence**
   - `eval_bots/vs_random_bot` > 0.85
   - `eval_bots/vs_greedy_bot` > 0.70
   - `eval_bots/vs_defensive_bot` > 0.60
   - All targets exceeded = mastery

3. ✅ **Combined Score Threshold**
   - `eval_bots/combined_score` > 0.75 and stable for 100 episodes
   - Weighted average accounts for all difficulties

4. ✅ **Value Function Converged**
   - `train/explained_variance` > 0.95 
   - AND `game_critical/episode_reward` no improvement for 200 episodes
   - Model has learned as much as possible from current scenarios

---

**Stop Training When (FAILURE - any of):**

1. ❌ **No Progress After Extended Training**
   - Win rate < target for phase after 200% of expected episodes
   - Example: Phase 1 win rate < 40% after 100 episodes (2x the 50 target)

2. ❌ **Catastrophic Forgetting**
   - Win rate drops > 20% and doesn't recover after 100 episodes
   - Indicates policy has collapsed

3. ❌ **Invalid Action Epidemic**
   - `game_critical/invalid_action_rate` > 10% persistently
   - Agent not learning rules correctly

4. ❌ **Training Instability**
   - `train/approx_kl` > 0.05 for 50+ consecutive updates
   - Policy diverging, training will not converge

---

**Continue Training When:**
- ✅ Win rate improving (even if slowly - 1-2% per 50 episodes)
- ✅ Eval bot performance increasing
- ✅ New tactical behaviors emerging in replays (manual inspection)
- ✅ Explained variance still improving (< 0.95)
- ✅ No early stopping criteria met

---

### TensorBoard Analysis Workflow

**Daily Training Review (5 minutes):**

1. **Open TensorBoard:**
```bash
tensorboard --logdir ./tensorboard/
# Navigate to http://localhost:6006
```

2. **Check Scalars → game_critical/**
   - **win_rate_100ep:** Trending upward? Target for phase?
   - **episode_reward:** Increasing? Any sudden drops?
   - **kill_ratio:** > 1.0? Improving?
   - **invalid_action_rate:** = 0%? Any spikes?

3. **Check Scalars → train/**
   - **explained_variance:** > target for phase? (0.70/0.85/0.90)
   - **approx_kl:** < 0.02? Any spikes > 0.03?
   - **clip_fraction:** 20-30%? Too high (>40%) or too low (<10%)?
   - **entropy_loss:** Decreasing gradually? Not collapsed?

4. **Check Scalars → eval_bots/**
   - **vs_random_bot:** > target? (0.70/0.80/0.85)
   - **vs_greedy_bot:** Improving? > 0.50 by Phase 3?
   - **vs_defensive_bot:** Improving? > 0.40 by Phase 3?
   - **combined_score:** Balanced across bots or biased?

5. **Action Decision:**
   ```
   IF all metrics on target AND improving:
       ✅ Continue training, check again tomorrow
   
   ELIF plateau detected (no improvement 50+ episodes):
       🔧 Adjust hyperparameters (see Adjustment Guide above)
       
   ELIF oscillation detected (wild swings):
       🔧 Reduce learning rate by 50%
       
   ELIF overfitting detected (self-play good, bots bad):
       🔧 Add more diverse scenarios
       
   ELIF diverging (approx_kl > 0.03 frequently):
       🔧 Reduce learning rate AND clip_range
   ```

---

**Weekly Deep Analysis (30 minutes):**

1. **Compare Phases:**
   - Select multiple runs in TensorBoard
   - Check if Phase 2 built on Phase 1 skills
   - Verify Phase 3 retained Phase 2 improvements

2. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Does explained_variance correlate with win_rate?
   - Does entropy decrease correlate with policy convergence?
   - Do bot win rates scale together or diverge?

3. **Replay Analysis:**
   ```bash
   # Watch actual agent gameplay
   python ai/train.py --test-only --test-episodes 5 --replay
   ```
   - Is agent using learned tactics from each phase?
   - Any unexpected behaviors or bugs?
   - Is positioning improving in Phase 3?

4. **Strategic Planning:**
   - Should training continue? (Check early stopping criteria)
   - Should Phase 4 be added? (if agent mastered Phase 3 too easily)
   - Should rewards be rebalanced for next training run?

---

**Monthly Review (1 hour):**

1. **Performance Benchmarking:**
   - Compare current agent to previous versions
   - Test against human players (if available)
   - Identify weaknesses for next training iteration

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Review all adjustments made
   - Which worked? Which didn't?
   - Update default configs based on learnings

3. **Documentation Update:**
   - Update this document with new patterns discovered
   - Add new troubleshooting entries
   - Share insights with team

### Observation Space Compatibility

**UPGRADED: Egocentric 150-float observation system (October 2025)**

**Structure:**
```python
observation = np.concatenate([
    current_unit_features,    # 30 floats - Active unit state
    ally_units_features,      # 60 floats - 2 nearest allies × 30 features
    enemy_units_features,     # 60 floats - 2 nearest enemies × 30 features
])
# Total: 150 floats
```

**Feature Encoding (per unit):**
- Position: x, y (2 floats)
- Health: HP_CUR, HP_MAX (2 floats)
- Combat stats: BS, WS, Attacks, Damage (4 floats)
- Defensive: Armor, Toughness (2 floats)
- Weapons: Range, Type (2 floats)
- Status: In cover, Has LOS, Moved this turn (3 floats)
- Relative: Distance to active unit, Angle (2 floats)
- Padding: 13 floats reserved for future features

**Key Properties:**
- **Egocentric:** Always from perspective of active unit
- **Fixed size:** Always 150 floats regardless of unit count
- **Normalized:** All values scaled to [0, 1] or [-1, 1]
- **Complete:** Includes all tactically relevant information

---

### Action Space Mapping

**12 Discrete Actions:**
```python
ACTION_SPACE = {
    0: "wait",                    # End turn
    1: "move_north",
    2: "move_south",
    3: "move_east",
    4: "move_west",
    5: "ranged_attack_target_0",  # Shoot nearest enemy
    6: "ranged_attack_target_1",  # Shoot 2nd nearest
    7: "ranged_attack_target_2",  # Shoot 3rd nearest
    8: "ranged_attack_target_3",  # Shoot 4th nearest
    9: "melee_attack_target_0",   # Melee nearest
    10: "melee_attack_target_1",  # Melee 2nd nearest
    11: "special_ability"         # Future: psychic powers, etc.
}
```

**Action Masking:**
```python
def get_action_mask(self) -> np.ndarray:
    """Return valid actions for MaskablePPO."""
    mask = np.zeros(12, dtype=bool)
    
    # Check each action type
    if self.can_wait():
        mask[0] = True
    
    for direction in [1, 2, 3, 4]:
        if self.can_move(direction):
            mask[direction] = True
    
    targets = self.get_valid_targets()
    for i, target in enumerate(targets[:4]):
        if self.can_shoot(target):
            mask[5 + i] = True
        if self.can_melee(target):
            mask[9 + i] = True
    
    return mask
```

**Key Constraints (from AI_TURN.md):**
- ✅ One action per unit per shooting phase
- ✅ Cannot shoot and move in same phase
- ✅ Movement only in movement phase
- ✅ Cannot shoot adjacent enemies
- ✅ Must have Line of Sight (LOS)

## 💰 REWARD SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### Loading Rewards from Config

```python
class W40KEngine(gym.Env):
    def __init__(self, rewards_config: str, ...):
        # Load rewards configuration
        config = get_config_loader()
        self.rewards = config.load_rewards_config(rewards_config)
        
        # Extract reward values
        self.action_rewards = self.rewards['base_actions']
        self.result_bonuses = self.rewards['result_bonuses']
        self.situational_mods = self.rewards['situational_modifiers']
```

### Reward Calculation

```python
def _calculate_reward(self, action_result: Dict) -> float:
    """Calculate reward using hierarchical structure."""
    total_reward = 0.0
    
    # Tier 4: Base action reward
    action_type = action_result['action_type']
    if action_type in self.action_rewards:
        total_reward += self.action_rewards[action_type]
    
    # Tier 5: Hit/miss feedback
    if action_result.get('hit', False):
        total_reward += self.result_bonuses['hit_target']
    
    # Tier 3: Damage progress
    if action_result.get('wounded', False):
        total_reward += self.result_bonuses['wound_target']
    if action_result.get('damage_dealt', 0) > 0:
        total_reward += self.result_bonuses['damage_target']
    
    # Tier 2: Critical events
    if action_result.get('killed', False):
        total_reward += self.result_bonuses['kill_target']
    if action_result.get('friendly_fire', False):
        total_reward += self.situational_mods['friendly_fire_penalty']
    
    # Tier 3: Situational bonuses
    if action_result.get('target_was_lowest_hp', False):
        total_reward += self.situational_mods['target_lowest_hp']
    
    # Tier 1: Terminal outcomes
    if action_result.get('game_over', False):
        if action_result['winner'] == 0:
            total_reward += self.situational_mods['win']
        else:
            total_reward += self.situational_mods['lose']
    
    return total_reward
```

**Key Principles:**
- Accumulate rewards across tiers
- Higher tier rewards dominate (by design)
- No single reward component overwhelms others
- Dense feedback throughout episode

## 🔄 MODEL INTEGRATION STRATEGIES

### Loading Existing Models

**Strategy 1: Continue Training (`--append`)**
```python
# Load existing model and continue training
model_path = "ai/models/current/model_SpaceMarine_Infantry_Troop_RangedSwarm.zip"

if os.path.exists(model_path):
    model = MaskablePPO.load(
        model_path, 
        env=env,
        custom_objects={
            "learning_rate": new_learning_rate,  # Can override hyperparameters
            "clip_range": new_clip_range
        }
    )
    print(f"✅ Loaded model from {model_path}")
else:
    raise FileNotFoundError(f"Model not found: {model_path}")
```

**Strategy 2: Create New Model (`--new`)**
```python
# Create fresh model (Phase 1 or fresh start)
model = MaskablePPO(
    "MlpPolicy",
    env,
    learning_rate=training_config['learning_rate'],
    n_steps=training_config['n_steps'],
    batch_size=training_config['batch_size'],
    ent_coef=training_config['ent_coef'],
    clip_range=training_config['clip_range'],
    policy_kwargs=training_config['policy_kwargs'],
    verbose=1,
    tensorboard_log="./tensorboard/"
)
print("✅ Created new model from scratch")
```

**Strategy 3: Transfer Learning (Advanced)**
```python
# Load Phase 2 model, freeze early layers, train Phase 3
base_model = MaskablePPO.load("phase2_model.zip")

# Extract policy network
policy_net = base_model.policy.mlp_extractor

# Freeze early layers
for param in policy_net.policy_net[:2].parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Continue training with frozen layers
# (Advanced - not typically necessary for W40K)
```

---

### Model Persistence

**Automatic Saves:**
```python
# Via CheckpointCallback
checkpoint_callback = CheckpointCallback(
    save_freq=10000,
    save_path="./models/checkpoints/",
    name_prefix="ppo_w40k"
)

model.learn(
    total_timesteps=training_config['total_timesteps'],
    callback=[checkpoint_callback, ...]
)

# Saves: ppo_w40k_10000_steps.zip, ppo_w40k_20000_steps.zip, ...
```

**Manual Save:**
```python
# Save after training completes
final_model_path = config.get_model_path()
model.save(final_model_path)
print(f"✅ Model saved to {final_model_path}")
```

**Best Model via Bot Evaluation:**
```python
# BotEvaluationCallback automatically saves best model
class BotEvaluationCallback(BaseCallback):
    def _on_step(self):
        if results['combined'] > self.best_combined_score:
            self.best_combined_score = results['combined']
            best_model_path = f"{self.save_path}_best_vs_bots.zip"
            self.model.save(best_model_path)
            print(f"🌟 New best model saved: {best_model_path}")
```

---

## 🚂 TRAINING PIPELINE INTEGRATION

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Training Multiple Agents:**
```python
# Train all agents in scenario
python ai/train.py --orchestrate --training-config phase1

# Orchestrator will:
# 1. Load scenario.json
# 2. Identify all unique unit types
# 3. Train each agent sequentially or in parallel
# 4. Save individual models per agent type
```

**Sequential Training:**
```python
def start_multi_agent_orchestration(config, total_episodes, ...):
    scenario = ScenarioManager.load_scenario(scenario_file)
    agents = scenario.get_active_agents()
    
    for agent_key in agents:
        print(f"Training agent: {agent_key}")
        
        model, env, training_config, model_path = create_multi_agent_model(
            config, training_config_name, rewards_config_name, agent_key
        )
        
        success = train_model(model, training_config, callbacks, model_path)
        
        if not success:
            print(f"❌ Training failed for {agent_key}")
            return False
    
    return True
```

---

### Callbacks System

**Standard Callbacks:**
```python
def setup_callbacks(config, model_path, training_config, training_config_name):
    callbacks = []
    
    # 1. Episode Termination (exact episode count)
    callbacks.append(EpisodeTerminationCallback(
        max_episodes=training_config['total_episodes'],
        expected_timesteps=training_config['total_timesteps']
    ))
    
    # 2. Checkpoint saves
    callbacks.append(CheckpointCallback(
        save_freq=10000,
        save_path=os.path.dirname(model_path),
        name_prefix="checkpoint"
    ))
    
    # 3. Metrics collection
    callbacks.append(MetricsCollectionCallback(
        training_config=training_config,
        rewards_config=rewards_config,
        model_path=model_path
    ))
    
    # 4. Bot evaluation (if bots available)
    if EVALUATION_BOTS_AVAILABLE:
        callbacks.append(BotEvaluationCallback(
            eval_freq=5000,
            n_eval_episodes=20,
            save_path=model_path
        ))
    
    return callbacks
```

---

## ⚡ PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

### Training Speed Optimization

**1. Use Debug Config for Testing:**
```json
// config/training_config.json → debug
{
  "total_episodes": 10,
  "total_timesteps": 5000,
  "n_steps": 128,
  "batch_size": 16
}
```
**Purpose:** Verify training pipeline works in 30 seconds

---

**2. Scenario Complexity:**
```json
// Simpler scenarios = faster episodes
{
  "player_0": {
    "units": [
      {"type": "SpaceMarine_Infantry_Troop_RangedSwarm", "count": 3}  // Not 10
    ]
  }
}
```
**Impact:** 3 units vs 10 units = 3x faster episodes

---

**3. Vectorized Environments (Future):**
```python
# Train with 4 parallel environments
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import SubprocVecEnv

def make_env():
    return W40KEngine(...)

env = SubprocVecEnv([make_env for _ in range(4)])
model = MaskablePPO("MlpPolicy", env, ...)

# 4x faster data collection
```

---

**4. GPU Acceleration:**
```python
# Check if CUDA available
import torch
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")

# PPO automatically uses GPU if available
# Network size [256, 256] → 2-3x faster on GPU
```

---

## 📋 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT

### Config Files Structure

```
config/
├── training_config.json       # Hyperparameters for each phase
├── rewards_config.json        # Reward values for each phase
├── scenario.json              # Battle scenarios
└── units_data.json            # Unit statistics
```

**Never hardcode values in code - always use config files.**

---

### Training Config Example

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Curriculum Training Issues

#### Issue: Phase 1 win rate stuck at 30%

**Symptom:** Agent still waits >50% of the time after 50 episodes

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check metrics in TensorBoard:
# game_critical/episode_reward should be increasing
# train/explained_variance should reach 0.70+
```

**Fix:**
1. Increase wait penalty: `"wait": -7.0` (from -5.0)
2. Increase shoot reward: `"ranged_attack": 7.0` (from 5.0)
3. Check entropy coefficient: Should be 0.20 (high exploration)

---

#### Issue: Phase 2 not improving target selection

**Symptom:** Agent picks random targets, doesn't prioritize weak enemies

**Diagnosis:**
```python
# Check if target_lowest_hp bonus is being applied
# Add logging in reward calculation:
print(f"Target HP: {target['HP_CUR']}, Bonus applied: {target_lowest_hp_bonus}")
```

**Fix:**
1. Increase priority bonus: `"target_lowest_hp": 10.0` (from 8.0)
2. Verify observation includes target HP correctly
3. Check that target selection action mask includes HP data

---

#### Issue: Phase 3 unstable (win rate oscillates 40-80%)

**Symptom:** Win rate swings wildly, doesn't converge

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check KL divergence in TensorBoard
# Look at: train/approx_kl
# If >0.03: Learning rate too high
```

**Fix:**
1. Reduce learning rate: `"learning_rate": 0.0001` (from 0.0003)
2. Reduce clip range: `"clip_range": 0.15` (from 0.2)
3. Increase batch size: `"batch_size": 128` (from 64)

---

#### Issue: Phase transition doesn't load previous model

**Symptom:** Phase 2 starts with 0% win rate (like Phase 1)

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if --append flag was used
# Check model file exists:
ls -la ai/models/current/model_SpaceMarine_Infantry_Troop_RangedSwarm.zip
```

**Fix:**
1. Always use `--append` flag for Phase 2 and 3
2. If file missing, model wasn't saved - check for errors
3. Verify model path matches expected location

---

### Metrics Issues

#### Issue: game_critical/ metrics not appearing

**Symptom:** TensorBoard only shows train/ namespace

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
python ./check/check_metrics.py
# Check if game_critical/ appears in output
```

**Fix:**
1. Verify `MetricsCollectionCallback` is using `model.logger.record()`
2. Check that `model.logger.dump()` is called after recording
3. Ensure metrics_tracker is NOT creating separate SummaryWriter

---

#### Issue: Metrics in wrong directory

**Symptom:** Two directories in ./tensorboard/ (PPO_1 and agent-specific)

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
ls -la ./tensorboard/
# Should see only PPO_* directories
```

**Fix:**
1. Delete old directories: `rm -rf ./tensorboard/*`
2. Verify callback uses `model.logger` not `metrics_tracker.writer`
3. Retrain from scratch

---

#### Issue: check_metrics.py shows "MISSING"

**Symptom:** Script reports metrics missing despite TensorBoard showing them

**Fix:**
Check that `expected_critical` list uses correct namespace names:
- Use `train/policy_gradient_loss` NOT `training_critical/policy_loss`
- Use `train/value_loss` NOT `training_critical/value_loss`

---

### Bot Evaluation Issues

**Issue: Bot evaluation shows mock results**
```python
# Symptom: Win rates are random.uniform() values
# Fix: Ensure _evaluate_against_bots() is updated with real implementation
# Check: BotControlledEnv class exists and is imported correctly
```

**Issue: Bot makes invalid actions**
```python
# Symptom: Bot action fails validation, game crashes
# Fix: Ensure action masking is enforced
def _get_bot_action(self):
    valid_actions = [i for i in range(12) if action_mask[i]]
    bot_choice = self.bot.select_action(valid_actions)
    
    # Validate before returning
    if bot_choice not in valid_actions:
        return valid_actions[0]  # Safe fallback
    
    return bot_choice
```

**Issue: Bot doesn't follow AI_TURN.md rules**
```python
# Symptom: Bot can shoot adjacent enemies, move twice, etc.
# Fix: Bot uses SAME W40KEngine as agent - rules enforced automatically
# Both players go through: env.step() → controller → handlers
# Action masking prevents invalid actions for both agent and bot
```

---

### Training Performance Issues

#### Issue: Training extremely slow (>2 minutes per 10 episodes)

**Diagnosis:**
- Check scenario complexity (too many units?)
- Check network size (too large?)
- Check if running on CPU instead of GPU

**Fix:**
1. Use debug config for testing: `--training-config debug`
2. Reduce scenario units: 3 per side instead of 10
3. Check GPU usage: `nvidia-smi` (if available)

---

#### Issue: Model not learning anything (random performance)

**Diagnosis:**
- Check observation space: Are values normalized?
- Check reward magnitude: Too small (<0.1) or too large (>1000)?
- Check action masking: Is it working?

**Fix:**
1. Verify observation values in [0, 1] or [-1, 1]
2. Scale rewards appropriately (see Reward Engineering section)
3. Test action masking manually
